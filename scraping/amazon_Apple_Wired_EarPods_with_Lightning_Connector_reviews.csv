Jawahar K,Quality and Durability,Most loveable product for me personally as the MIC and sound quality is so good and clear. Especially while speaking the phone it give clear quality of voice. Also very user friendly and durability is high. Worth for money we can buy if you are looking for the wired Apple headphones ü§©
rohit das,"Solid Performance, Reliable Connection","It deliver impressive sound quality with clear highs and deep lows. The wired design ensures a stable connection, and the comfortable fit is perfect for extended use. The inline remote adds convenience for easy control. While lacking wireless features, these EarPods are a reliable choice for those prioritizing consistent performance."

Sahib Singh,FOR BGMI Almost Perfect But... the noise cancellation of mic is not good,"The raw noise cancellation of its mic is not good. Although it is fine when an app does the noise cancellation from itself. In bgmi the background noise from the mic is terrifying for team mates, have to shift to a quitter room. For game play i would say that these earphones are pretty good but not as good as the hyperx ones because during intense situations when there are multiple sounds , it may become harder to notice the important sound of footsteps. But according to the price segment these are just worth it. Only raw noise cancellation of mic lacks."
C A RAGHUNATH,Refund pl,"Item is not suitable for the device

SD Das,Good but not justified as it price,"Hey Guy‚Äôs I‚Äôm Subhadeep and now I‚Äôm going to share my POV about this Earphones in 2023, should you buy it ? Or not !

I have many IEM‚Äôs in this price segment, like KZ ZSN PRO X, Blon BL03 and Moondrop CHU. As my opinion these are sounds very natural, bass is not deep, treble is ok but main the mids are too good üòå, if you want to buy it for listening podcasts, YouTube videos, movies this will be a great choice for you. One of the major point of these the mic quality i want to give 10/10 on mic quality. It‚Äôs mic is better than my AirPods pro which i have since 2022.

Build quality is not great. Please buy a earphone case with it.

Bass- 5/10
Mids- 9/10
Treble- 7/10
Mic quality and calling- 10/10

*fitting could be a problem who are not use to with half an ear design buds, so please try it‚Äôs fitting before you r planning to buy it.

Overall good but not best in this segment."
