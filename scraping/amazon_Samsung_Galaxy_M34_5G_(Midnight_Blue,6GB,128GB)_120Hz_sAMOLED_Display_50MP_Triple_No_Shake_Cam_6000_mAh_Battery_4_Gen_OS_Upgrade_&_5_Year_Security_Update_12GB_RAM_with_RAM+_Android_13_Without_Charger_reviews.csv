Camera 4.5/5
Performance 4/5
Battery 5/5

Cons are slow charging & touch response. Not a deal breaker as one Full charge will be sufficient for more than a day."
Haaris,Satisfied purchase,"I bought it during Festive sale along with charger. Applying Debit card offer it came around 15k. I feel its worth product. Camera quality is good. Battery also stands well. What else? I felt little heat during my first call, now i dont feel. Might be i got used to it. Finger print is in power button. I feel it as a negative point."

doman sonkar,IDEAL BUDGET PHONE FOR THE WORKAHOLICS,IDEAL BUDGET PHONE FOR THE WORKAHOLICS
MANISH B.,C to C cable may disappoint,"The data cable with the pack is C to C not USB to C....this may cause you a great disappointment and of course another 6-700 rs cost if you do not have ctype charger at home like me. I have to now run to shop first to get a new charger before I start using the phone. With cool transfer features, I could set up phone fast, but still can not use it.
Amazon/Samsung dealers should understand that CtoC is not common and should make it more obvious and possibly include charger in the pack."
Basanti Lata Das,Preformance,Samsung galaxy m34 is Good Phone but charger not included in the box.
,Good for price,"Battery, camera, storage and almost everything is good for this price. Good for non-gamers and light users."
Amazon Customer,Outstanding for the price,"There is so much good to say and so much options to tweak if you're a techie.

Just two of them standout. The fantastic crispy colourful display and the One UI 6 on top of Android 13.

Samsung had made tremendous changes to make the phone pleasing to youngsters and to give a tough to the competitors of the segment.

Decent audio for this price although Dolby Atmos is like a namesake option. Not to be bothered. Single speaker audio output is decent. Good headset can deliver pleasing audio. Bluetooth audio is also very good, seems like 16 bit, 44 KHz CD quality audio.

Audio focus during calls and adaptive/selective background noise reduction/elimination, dynamic audio gain, audio output enhancement for different age people are all thoughtful enhancements.

AI has few implementations and you may find it useful at times and intrusive sometimes.

Camera is average but the software adjusts/beautifies/enhances the image and has AI support from Bixby for scanning, text extraction, speaking the text of the captured image in multiple languages are all outstanding.

No one regrets this phone for the price. I got it for 15K on a Christmas offer.

Note of caution: Super slippery front, back & sides requires a suitable cover.

Kudos Samsung."

Placeholder,Overall Review Afe1month Used.,"Phone is good quality in feature but there is various types of settings that cofused me . camera work is good üëç but Samsung has pree installed various type of un necessary applications.new software update is not so good ,after software update my phone was blocked and I was bound to go near about 150km.to restart my phone . I think below 15000 it is not bad.Any one can purchased it."
Placeholder,Good Mobile,"Mobile was good and worth for money. But packing was somewhat not fulfilled, because there is no box secured packing."
AKILAN VASUDEVAN,Good product,I suggest all of you please purchase this product without any doubt
Arun Das,8/10,"Every feature of this phone is excellent but Samsung compromised in Display and sound here, Display is not clear, average phones under 8k have better Display in it. When the volume is full it becomes like cacophony sometimes."

Ajay Singh,nice,nice
Placeholder,It is sturdy,Right price
Harsh Kumar,"Does not feels, this phone has 6000 mAH battery.","1) Camera - The camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. Even 13MP selfie camera is more clear and bright as compare to other smart phones.
2) 120Hz Super Amoled Display - I have played Netflix Movies, Youtube videos, etc and the display quality good but always use the tempered glass because if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.
3) Software and Security - In just Rs.15000, you are getting ONE UI full version which is a great thing. One UI has many security features like Secure Folder, Samsung Knox, etc.
4) Processor - Exynos 1280 5nm is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommended for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot. Don't use it for gaming. It is good for day-to-day tasks like content watching, social media, email, web browsing, online shopping etc. There is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue. it's completely fine. Sometimes it feels warm but I'll say it's not normal and not bad at Rs.15000 is a good deal.
Phone has slightly warm issue on its back side. Also slightly heat during charging but it's not a major point because it is not always. I hope it will be more stabled in upcoming updates because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled.
5) Battery - 6000mAh battery used in this device. The backup is good but not at that level which is explained on paper. It will give you 8 to 10 hours screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use.
6) Build Quality - It's build quality is not good. Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also high. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's build quality. A normal drop from normal hight may cause damage in your phone.
7) Feel in hand - It is a nominal size phone with 6.6"" super amoled display and 6000 mAH battery which does not feel so heavy and big. Screen touch also works good."
