Pritam Shetty,Smooth Transition to iPhone 14 Plus,"I recently made the switch from Android to the iPhone 14 Plus, and it has been a remarkably smooth transition. Here are some key points about my experience:

1. Seamless Setup: Setting up my new iPhone was a breeze. Apple's migration tool effortlessly transferred all my contacts, photos, and apps from my Android device. It was a stress-free process that ensured I didn't lose any important data.

2. Intuitive User Interface: The iOS interface on the iPhone 14 Plus is incredibly user-friendly. Navigating through the device, customizing settings, and finding apps is straightforward, even for someone who was accustomed to Android.

3. Performance: The iPhone 14 Plus packs a powerful punch. The device runs smoothly, and apps load quickly. Multitasking is a breeze, thanks to the robust hardware and optimized software.

4. Display: The OLED display on the iPhone 14 Plus is stunning. Colors are vibrant, and the screen is sharp and clear. It's a joy to use for watching videos, browsing, and gaming.

5. Camera: The camera quality on the iPhone 14 Plus is exceptional. The photos and videos captured are rich in detail and clarity. The advanced camera features and modes provide ample opportunities for creativity.

6. App Ecosystem: The App Store offers a vast selection of high-quality apps that enhance the iPhone experience. I found all my favorite Android apps and discovered some excellent iOS exclusives.

7. Privacy and Security: Apple's commitment to user privacy and security is evident. Features like App Tracking Transparency and Face ID add an extra layer of protection.

8. Battery Life: The battery life on the iPhone 14 Plus is impressive. I can comfortably go through a day of heavy usage without worrying about running out of power.

In conclusion, my transition from Android to the iPhone 14 Plus has been a positive one. The device offers a premium experience with a top-notch camera, excellent performance, and an ecosystem that keeps everything well-integrated. If you're considering the switch, I highly recommend it for a seamless and satisfying smartphone experience."
Gokul,It‚Äôs my first iPhone experience,"It‚Äôs my first iphone and i see that it has a verygood battery life, as I‚Äôve used it for 15-16 days and one single charge upto 100% can easily hold till 2complete days, in one charge cycle I‚Äôve watched
6eposids of 30mins each and a movie of 2hr25min.
Overall batter is really osm, I didn‚Äôt expect this from iphone. I usually keep the power between 30% to 80% and this holds for 1 to 1(1/2) in a decent use of continuous screen time about 5 to 6hrs smoothly.
Well battery is good..
(single battery% stands for 9-10minutes on light usage if rough usage then 7-8min definitely)

Now come to it‚Äôs performance,
Obviously with appleA15 chipset it‚Äôs really soo smooth, overall having a 60hz display while all ther brand are running with 120hz display. But still i say it is smooth to a good decent level.
If i come to gaming side, no doubt u can go for it, but as its display is 60hz it may get u some change if u are a heavy gamer(I‚Äôm don‚Äôt play much gamesüòÖ)

Well come to the camera part,
Obviously iPhones are verywell known for their camera quality, compared to pro series it has only 12+12 Mp camera setup it doesn‚Äôt have 48mp setup as pro. But still it best pics as good as pro.

On screen brightness I not impressed with it, It‚Äôs not that bright to see under heavy sunlight quite difficult but can be seen but not clear.
Well compared to pro, pro can be easily seen under heavy sun easily without any difficulties. Can be seen clearly.

On waterproof, no doubt you can swim with it üòÖ
I‚Äôve done it twice and daily I carry it while I‚Äôm bathing.
Definitely üëç good.

On build quality, screen with ceramic display it‚Äôs really soo durable, I‚Äôve placed screen on heavy surfaces without tempered glass and i can‚Äôt see any scratches on the screen. But edges are quite disappointing with aluminium frame is quite delicate on third day after buying it slipped from my had on one side of edge and boom it shot with a slight dent on edge.

If i talk about Speakers they are really good and easily audible at a heavy traffic noise too. Overall speakers are good üëç

Overall i can say it‚Äôs worth to spend 80k on this mobile.
So you can go for it."
Manhan,Apple is a proven product..,Good product
Mallajeet Sonowal,First experience with IOS - its different,"I am writing this review after using it for1 month. This is my first apple device. I upgraded from OP7T to this device. My prime requirement was superior battery life and looking for an overall decent good phone. So I was initially inclined to buying OP 11 but ever since OP was acquired by VIVO, I felt that OP has lost its originality and as a result my interest for OP11 was somehow withdrawn. After one month of usage of IP14+, I find that in some aspect IOS is superior to android and in some other aspects android is superior to IOS. As a very normal mobile phone user, I‚Äôll try to highlight the difficulties and good aspects of the device I noticed while using it for the last one month:

Pros:

1. Battery life is outstanding. When I was using single sim, I was having 40-42 hrs. of battery backup with moderate usage ( I don‚Äôt play games, moderate usage includes streaming content in Netflix, Hotstar etc. for 2-3 hrs.). When I started using duel sim also, the battery life is easily lasting for more than 36 hrs.

2. I absolutely liked the Face ID feature and I really appreciate the security features offered by IOS. Be it for banking app or for any other apps, no unnecessary third party apps are required for protection & privacy of apps. My child can‚Äôt install any gaming app without my Faceid and it is such a relief.

3. Astounding sound quality. This phone bar delivers amazing sound output. You‚Äôll experience absolute satisfaction while watching content in this phone with such high quality sound output. My wife is using Galaxy S22 Ultra and I find that the sound output of IP14+ is superior to this.

4. I read that screen refresh rate is 60Hz, but it hardly mattered to me. I could not notice any distraction due to this in my day to day activities. But I must say that watching content in S22 Ultra is more eye-pleasing but this does not mean that screen quality of IP14+ is any less than the S22 series.

5. Duel 12 megapixel camera offers you such incredible picture quality that many flagship android phones with triple/ quadruple camera having fancy megapixels should feel ashamed of. Day or night , you get awesome photos. No unnecessary beautifying of photos , you simply see what you click. If I look bad, the camera will show me just like that. Video quality is also great specially in cinematic mode.

6. Lesser battery & lesser ram than most of the android phones out there but performs like a beast non-stop.

Cons:

1. Android is so easy to use. It gives you the liberty to do as per your own terms. As a very normal user of mobile , simple activities like toggling with SIM data, choosing the sim to call, auto connection of Bluetooth with car (once it is paired), browsing the file manager, copying & pasting any files to & from the mobile device, connecting a SSD / pen drive etc. is such a piece of cake in android phones. In IOS, calls will only go from the primary sim. You do not get the choice of selecting the sim to call your contacts. You can call a contact from your secondary sim only if you received a call from the caller in the secondary sim. I normally toggle between Jio & Airtel for mobile data. Toggling the mobile data is so damn easy in android phones through drop down menu but in IOS I have to go to settings everytime to select the primary / secondary sim for default data.

2. File browsing in IOS is another nightmare for me. In 1 month I started missing the android file browsing utility. I can not copy a file from external source (pendrive / ssd) to iphone. When connected to PC, I am only allowed to copy camera photos and videos to PC. May be IOS is restricting all these to enhance security of the device which I really appreciate but can‚Äôt help forgetting the swiftness of android handling all these shortcomings.

3. Can you imagine, the calculator app can not handle any sum involving more than 9 digits.

4. As I said camera in this phone is great. But I paid 90 thousand for the phone and for the price paid for I at least deserved a macro lens and 3x optical zoom lens in the camera system. Forget about macro photography & zooming if you are sticking with non-pro versions.

Anyways, pro‚Äôs & con‚Äôs makes a product perfect. Despite all the shortfalls which are bothering me, I liked this device because in many other important aspects it outperformed other flagship android devices. In the end I must say, for battery, ram management and security IOS rocks and for ease of use android rocks."
,best,My first iphone . I loved it. Impressed with the battery life. very smooth to handle. overall superb phone
Kshitija sontakke,Hats off to Apple. The 14 Plus - a class apart phone.,"Its a big myth that Android phone are better than iPhone. I was with samsung flag ship mobile previously and Samsung never come even close to iPhone in any aspect. After saying this, there is no need to discuss any other android phones in the market.

You only understand this beauty only once you use it. Go for it. The battery life is outstanding. The display, look and feel and the seem less fluidic way of its presence is immaculate.

The 14 Plus - a class apart phone."
Mohan Jakkula,Apple catalog completed,"I have all the apple products except for the iPhone. This is my first iPhone after sticking to android for 12 years.
Main reason was for battery and I give full marks to apple for optimisation
Soft ware and hardware complement each other. I know most of them debate android vs apple, my opinion is that apple maintains consistency and keeps on optimising its OS and also has clear vision on privacy
I‚Äôm happy overall"

Lovepreet singh,I got in very good price on amazon.,
,"Plus sized iPhone , not for all","The phone is a standard iPhone blown up to the pro max proportion. While tech reviewers might consider this phone a failure , for those who need a good battery and a large screen will love this.

In the us as price difference between this and pro max is 200 , people will scale up and get that. However in India the price difference between this a pro max can get you an iPhone 12/13 itself. So it works best for the price.

89999 is expensive but I picked it up in the sale for 71 with some more cash back thrown in. Now the value promise is damn enticing.

As it uses the 13pro‚Äôs A15 processor and 2 back cameras from the 13pro , it‚Äôs no slouch. In the battery department as it‚Äôs a shameful 60hz display that it has to power , it lasts long. The lack of pro-motion display on a phone at this price point is a disgrace when even phones at half the price come with super amoled 120hz displays

That aside , as I use it exclusively for work I am happy with it. I take all my WebEx meetings from here and slack and outlook at refreshed fanatically when I‚Äôm on the move. I can read all the documents and not worry about eye strain.

I am not the best judge for camera as I use this only to capture moments rather than insta pics etc. but it takes decent photos. Post processing may not be for all.

Summarizing , it‚Äôs a good phone for a slightly inflated price point. It does a damn good job in being a phone that lasts long.

Update : after using it extensively for 2 weeks i charge it once in about 30-40 hours and this is not an exaggeration. I charge before i go to sleep and it lasts me the whole next day night + till the day after till noon or 2pm. This has been consistent behaviour with about 4-5 hours of screen on time."

Rahul Arora,Very lightweight and battery lasts long long time.,"Play Video
I am a Android user and just got my hands on iPhone just because of this Yellow dirty fellow color üíõ
I just loved the color and also wanted a light weight phone and as a fan of a big phones. This was perfect I guess. Because of that Apple hype and iPhone selfies you know. Also, its a different color which is unusual. I have not completely shifted to iPhone as I have kept my Android phone as well which is OnePlus 7T Pro, so, as its name, that phone is also a pro one only, using it from last 4 years and it still works like a beast, no performance issues.

So, let me tell you what I found good in this phone and what isn't going well.

Pros:
‚Ä¢ Very smooth screen and no performance issues.
‚Ä¢ Lightweight and attractive.
‚Ä¢ Battery lasts almost a day and half if you don't play games and use it normally.

Cons:
‚Ä¢ It is very delicate, and I got a little scratch on the screen very first day, as it wasn't protected by a screen guard but I just sliped it in my pocked and it may got rubbed with jeans pocket button on anything but screen should not be this delicate, so always go for a screen protector as it isn't scratchless screen.
‚Ä¢ Its a long long process to backup your iPhone if you have a windows PC. May be this is same with Mac, Idk but that's difficult.
‚Ä¢ You can't use it without a case and sides are to be covered all the time as they attract scratchs and dents very easily.
So, in built quality I must say, Apple should improve it."
,Fantastic phone,Original I phone
Hardik Kumar Rawal,Iphone 14 plus,
,Apple operating system so primitive..,"I don‚Äôt know why Apple phones are a craze..Notifications panel is a khichadi no organisation of messages like android.Phone app is so old ..no gallery and file manager integration
call drops are frequent.if u use camera for long or heavy use it heats pretty well as well as on charging.
Only battery back up is great along with video recording.Android is so advanced in most aspects.Truecaller doesn‚Äôt work have to pick all calls. wi if ko settings so jakar he off kar sakte ho..Spending so much money on it is waste.."
Nani,Good,Good
,Value King,"This review is not for those who want to switch from the immediate last gen iphones( 12,13).
If you are on an older iPhone , this phone will be a significant upgrade. Display, camera, battery, in all aspects.
If you are switching from android to iOS after 3-4 years or for the first time, this device will give you all you need without spending over a lac for the pro features which you may or may not need.
Camera - 8/10
Display - 10/10
Battery - 9/10
Audio output is excellent, plus the voice isolation in the mic is a godsend
A couple of things need to be said though.
At this price point, apple should not have skipped the 90hz refresh rate for this big a screen. This device has a 60hz refresh rate, which isn‚Äôt bad, per we. But if you‚Äôre coming from higher refresh rates, you will notice the difference. For example I am coming from the one plus 7pro which had 90hz. So I can tell the difference while scrolling and gaming. But should not be a deal breaker. Eyes get used to it in a day.
And dont fret too much about the display island, which isn‚Äôt available for this model.
Also the 20w adapter(not included), takes about 1 hour to an hour and 15 minutes to fully charge the phone.
P.S. If you can spend, go for the pro max. Just for the telephoto lens, macro mode, dynamic island and stainless steel frame which does not scratch as easily as aluminium on the iPhone 14/14 plus."

,Overhyped Useless Phone,"iPhone is an apt case of marketting on hype when fools are full around. I shifted from Android to this phone and I am just regretting my choice of having an iPhone. I have data extensive job where I need to share data seamlessly from my phone and need to do back also.
My Google One drive has stopped working on iPhone as from iPhone you can't use google drive backup to backup your phone data. So you need to buy iCloud. Ok I bought that too with Rs 200 PM for it, and yet I can't use it. Because with my email ID somewhere someone has mapped his phone number, and my email ID icloud does not take. Though all notifications of my iphone is coming on my same email ID which I access everyday!
So next was to map my phone number as apple ID. That I did. But using my phone as apple ID I cant log to icloud from anywhere else except my phone! You can't transfer your files using bluetooth to you PC because MC BC iPhone does not allow Bluetooth file transfer but only fancy Air*FcUking*Drop which again works only on Apple devices only...so you buy your laptop pad etc Apply only!
So you come to USB tethering to transfer the files...and here too, you feel suffocated as iPhone does not show your phone drive on any system except apple...so you can't transfer files even using USB tethering except useless photos and videos!
I strictly suggest you all to avoid taking iPhone and better stick to Android. After using android, you feel suffocated using this useless garbage called iPhone. Its just hype. Even data security is hype and useless. No one is better than Google drive in having secure backup of your every file and accessible everywhere. And iPhone stands nowhere near it. It is just monopolizing garbage trap to which any sensible person would not fall into. My sense gad gone for toss."

Best smart phone i bought ever"
Amazon Customer,Perfect phone when switching from android,"Post 2 week review:
I have just switched from android to iPhone. I didn‚Äôt before as I was used to large screen android phones and the normal iPhone was too small for me, also the Pro Max was too expensive and I really wasn‚Äôt interested in the camera too much. So when the iPhone plus came around I realised it was the perfect phone for me.
Even though they keep saying it‚Äôs camera, chipset etc ..is not as good as the PRO models, so far I haven‚Äôt seen anywhere it‚Äôs lacking. But for someone who‚Äôs into photography maybe there‚Äôll be a difference, however for the average user this phone is more than adequate. For this price I think this is the best deal!
It does take a while to get used to ios coming from android, but it‚Äôs nothing overwhelming, besides there are enough YouTube videos to guide you!
All in all I highly recommend this phone for those looking for a premium experience without any high end insane specs. And buy atleast 256 gb.. trust me..!"
Pjharii,"Except heating, everything else is good","Phone is very much heating even in AC rooms, especially during changing and under direct Sun light. Even iOS will stop charging automatically saying ‚ÄúThe phone is heat and will resume charging after phone coming back to normal temperature‚Äù

Used multiple iPhone models before but Didn‚Äôt faced this much heat from Apple. Haven‚Äôt expected this from iPhone."
Varun Bharadwaj,Battery Life - OMG. ‚ÄòNuff said,"I mainly starting looking for the phone with the best battery life. I‚Äôm getting over 2.5 days‚Ä¶yes DAYS..of usage. Dang! That‚Äôs the best battery life I‚Äôve seen in any phone I‚Äôve used so far.
The 60hz display doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs ultra smooth anyway. Most iPhones are.
The screen is great. Big, punchy. The software is stable. The Face ID is super helpful to not have to type in passwords systemwide.
I have to get used to the added heft though. I come from a Pixel 4a, which was a petite 5.8incher in a plastic shell.
The one downside to buying this phone is it‚Äôs lock-in with magsafe. Now I have to specifically purchase cases, car mounts, chargers etc that cater to it. None of my existing modes are compatible..including the cable. Lightning. Damn it, Apple!
All of these extras are easily going to pinch your pocket.. deeply..on top of the premium paid in purchasing an iPhone in India in the first place."
Sharran,BEAST OF A PHONE !!,"So I'm an android user for 15 years posting this review after one week of usage

Pros
1. Security - without your permission no app can track you
2. Camera - the quality and features and detailing is amazing. U can shoot a cinema with this beast !
3. Battery - huge battery that lasts easily one full day despite heavy usage
4. Fast and sleek - 0 lag experienced
5. Looks - I bought red and it's a killer
6. Display - big screen 6.7 and nothing to complaint at all
7. Features - it even tells u how long u slept last night üòÇ lots of options available under "" health "" that android can only dream of

Cons
1. iOS is not as easy/simple as android without the BACK button
2. It is expensive
As u can see the cons are literally nothing if u want a solid all-round mobile phone for the next 3-4 years atleast.. iPhone 14+ is amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è"
,"A decent iPhone, worth the price","Very satisfied with this product, happy not to spend an extra 30-35K on the pro/pro max models. The biggest pluses are the screen size, above average battery backup, and the lightness of weight. Feels premium, and the 60 Hz refresh rate isn't a dampener once you get used to using the phone. If your requirement isn't shooting movies and all, the camera quality is pretty good. Overall, the best buy in the iphone 14 series."
