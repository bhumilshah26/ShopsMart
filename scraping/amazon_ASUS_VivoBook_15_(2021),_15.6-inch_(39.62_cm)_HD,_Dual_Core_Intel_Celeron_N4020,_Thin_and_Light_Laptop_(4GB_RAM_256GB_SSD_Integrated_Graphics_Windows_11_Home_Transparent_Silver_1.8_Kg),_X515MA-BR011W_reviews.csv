SHAKIR MUQADUS WANI,Poor Quality product sold in sale.,"I have bitter experience with ASUS Vivo Book 15. Problem started within 8 months of purchase, ASUS Vivo Book 15 stop functioning from June 2023, service center team failed to identify issue in first visit and took nearly 3 months to resolve the issue. Issue identified as dysfunctional of motherboard. This was the period under guarantee. After 16 months of purchase, in Feb 2024 Battery became dysfunctional and the ASUS Vivo Book 15 given to service center for repairing. I have taken 1-year extended warranty/ guarantee, but battery is not covered in that. I think company knows that the battery becomes dysfunctional within 2 years that's why they did not covered under warranty/ guarantee scheme. I advise buyers of this product to think twice before making purchase decision. I will never buy any ASUS product in future. In fact, I am planning to take up the matter with consumer court as this is clear case of cheating the customer."

MALLESH.MK,Budget Laptop,"I like this product, because it's fitting on my budget

Pro's - NA
Con's - NA

Iam not discussing any pro's & con's because this is modarate processor laptop

This not for Heavy/gaming users
If he/she work is normal means goo for it
It is best fitting budget under 30K

Hence I didn't get any GST invoice, if Amazon see this review means plz share me the GST invoice copy because money is money"

Satyaki Bose,Very good budget laptop,"This a good budget laptop.
The laptop starts up really quick with 2-3 secs.
However, if you wish to run some basic office related apps such as MS Teams, or watch youtube videos with 4k resolution, I would recommend upgrading the RAM to additional 4GB.
Otherwise its a really good value for money.

Just a couple of moree suggestions:
1. remove the additional keypads from the right side.
2. add a backlit keyboard."

Abhijit baidya,Just go for it !!,"Read till the end.
Reviewing after 12 days of usage.
If your budget is around 27k and not purchasing for gaming then you should difinitely go for it. There are hardly any cons in this product.
#Built quality is upto the mark.
#Looks and feels premium like a 40k laptop
#Fingerprint sensor is what makes it different.
#Processing speed is fluent.
#Camera is ok ok (enough).
#Touchpad feels premium.
#SSD makes it a bit more buttery.
#Display quality is more than good in this budget.

The only problem i faced is regarding MS office as OFFICE 365 is pre installed without the activation key as a result we cant access it or we have to purchase it. But fortunately i installed MS office 2021 from external source in minutes so not a big deal.

So i would suggest everyone to go for it blindly and save some pennies without any disappointment cz i have been searching for laptop since 1 month and this fulfilled my all my requirements. Thank you"
,Fantastic,"Overall, it is a capable and portable laptop in this price. Its specifications are beyond my expectations
I'll consider it to buy"
Vimal Singh Saun,Good laptop,Nice laptop
,Super product,
Ashish,Affordable and lightweight,"Screen quality is substantially low, you could see little or less effect of anti-glare. Performance is also in the mid-range. All in all you can buy this laptop if you're not expecting too much from it and have a small budget. If you want this size laptop you definitely have to spend 5-7k more on heavy players in the market. Adapter is quite compact and windows apps need activation. Better than buying a used laptop or a chrome book."
,Good,Good product
MD BAYANUR ISLAM,Good,Good
,Only three months warranty provided,Laptop is good for normal office work and entertainment. Product quality is good. My only concern is about warranty which is 3 Months only. Customer has to pay extra money for extended warranty.
Ashish Ujgare,No Nano adapter provided,I got my parcel but in wireless mouse no Nano adapter then how how I can connect my laptop. And no cell provide for mouse please resolve problem ASAP
,Value for Money Product,"After one week light usage, this is the feeling: Decent laptop for everyday use.
Looks good, working smoothly ( browsing, document editing, music, movie, light gaming like 3D chess etc), fast booting, finger print scanner is a highlight, display is nice, good keypad- separate num keys (although missing num lock indication light), good touch pad, sound output quality is good, above average battery life depending upon the usage.
Operating system is windows 11, updated properly & working smoothly.
Thank you Asus & Amazon Team !!"
