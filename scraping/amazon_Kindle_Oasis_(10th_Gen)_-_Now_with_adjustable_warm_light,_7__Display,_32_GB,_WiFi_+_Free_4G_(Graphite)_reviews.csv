Sachin Chavan,Immersive experience equals more reading,"I upgraded to Kindle Oasis from a previous generation Kindle Paperwhite. My first kindle was the one with keyboard, I’ve been a Kindle user for over 10 years. And the Oasis is my third Kindle.

I won’t waste time explaining e-readers or e-ink here. Those who expect a tablet should stay away. I use an iPadPro as a tablet, and still feel it worth to have a Kindle to read e-books. I’d say you should consider buying a e-reader only if you read at least 20-25 books a year.

But if you read much more than that, and can afford it, do consider the Kindle Oasis in particular. While the Paperwhite at about 60% the Oasis’s price will give you most of the features, the Oasis’s design (flat thin bezel, weight distribution, one-handed grip, page up-down buttons) along with the warm lighting and speedy processing does a magic - “the Kindle disappears”. You are left only with the book you are reading, well-immersed in it. You kind of forget that you are holding an e-reader which is between you and the book. And this is the best compliment I can give to the Kindle Oasis. If you value this immersive experience, go for the Oasis. Otherwise the PW shall suffice. Am sure those who love reading books will end up reading more on the Oasis than they did on PW for this reason.

I won’t go into explaining the above features as Amazon and other reviewers have done a good job of it. Let me only point out the only negative of the Oasis which I have deducted a point for: the battery life. I’d say it’s about one-fourth the battery life of my previous gen Paperwhite (which I guess might beat even the current gen PW). I can expect around 15-20 hrs or so of reading with a single charge on the Oasis with the Wifi on and auto-lighting. I always keep it on as I refer the dictionary and Wikipedia often as I read. You could lengthen the life by using the Airplane mode and charge once a week instead. I so wish Amazon had beefed up the Oasis’s battery a bit. But this is in no way a deal-breaker. It’s no big deal for me to put the Kindle on charging every 3-4 days when I do the same for my phone every day.

I went for the 8GB model though the 32GB was available for only Rs 3000 more. That’s because the 32GB (Wifi) is available only in Golden color and seeing the golden border around the black bezel would have been distracting and spoilt the immersive experience I get from the grey Oasis whose border merges with the bezel. This was very important to me. And it made no sense to pay Rs 6000 more for the 32GB 4G version which was in grey color. Especially as Amazon has, for some unknown reason, not allowed Audible books to be played on Kindle in India. If they do in the future, I can always listen to them on the phone app. In any case, I am more of a book reader than listener.

So that’s it. If you love books and read a lot, the Kindle Oasis can be one of the best gifts you can give yourself. Any investment you do in books pays off. But if you aren’t a prolific reader who gets lost in her books, the lesser Kindle models would suffice. Only, once you buy a top end model, stop thinking about its price and do your best to use and enjoy it to the most."
Balabr,Rebooting every time I open the device,This device reboots every time I open this …Can anyone give any solution?
Chaitanya,Good but...,"I wanted to buy a cheap e-reader. But when I saw the features of Oasis, I was blown away and ended up purchasing this from a brick and mortal store in a mall nearby. I got some cashback also because of that. I bought the magnetic cover online. I've been using it for more than 6 months now.

The greatest advantage I've with e-books is that I don't need to wait to read something. I can just buy it online and it's there instantaneously. With that said, here are my pros and cons:

Pros:
1. The e-ink display ensures that there is no annoying glare from the screen
2. The same thing ensures that you can read for hours together without straining your eyes
3. The adjustable font is a boon, if you have tough time reading smaller fonts
4. Back light ensures that I can read it in dark without switching on bed light and getting annoying looks from my wife
5. Big books (about 1000 - 1500) pages also don't take a lot of time to download, even on the slower 2.4GHz Wifi
6. Not sure if the difference is me or the goodness of Oasis, I read 27 books in the last 7 months, which is the highest I've read in my entire life
7. Unless I want a book where I want to take a lot of notes and record my thinking, like Greek tragedies, epics or Shakespearean plays, or Telugu books, I don't see myself relying on hard copies for my reading pleasure
8. If you switch off auto-brightness and wifi, and read for about an hour a day, the batter would take about 2 - 3 weeks before it goes from 100% to 1%. If you can read in daylight or under artificial light and switch off the back light, the battery stays good even more

Cons:
1. Annoying as hell reading comics. But then it's the same in any e-reader
2. The grip sometimes slips as the back is too smooth. You've to catch it in a particularly awkward way to not let it slip. The cover gives some grip because of it's texture
3. No 5GHz reception. 2.4GHz Wifi is inherently crowded and so the connection is flaky for most of the time. Good that I switch it off once I purchase/download my books
4. Auto-brightness is touch and go. It works sometimes. It doesn't work many times
5. Battery life sucks if you keep on the wifi and/or auto-brightness
6. Doesn't fit in the pocket of my jeans. But way better than carrying a book and letting everyone see what I'm reading
7. If you plan on writing notes for anything, I feel sorry for you. I have the habit of writing notes. The typing is undeniably horrible. Suddenly in middle of your typing, the device selects all of your text and if you don't notice it, the text goes away without a chance for ""undo"". Also the typing is ultra slow. It's like waiting for an electronic typewriter to print all the text that you typed in one shot, hoping that you didn't type anything wrong."
Amazon Customer,"Gone back to reading, can quit OTT now","Kindle oasis is one of the best online purchases I have made. I have always loved reading but carrying a book everywhere can sometimes be difficult, and carrying books even more so. Kindle is very light weight, easy to hold, easy to turn pages and go back and reading itself on it is pleasant experience.
Books of 500+ pages are a little difficult to hold and read past 200 pages due to thickness. No such issue with this device.
Also, I can read without the need of a light source, thereby not disturbing others in a room at night is a huge plus point for me."
SSG,A device to read,"First and foremost, this is a device to read books. So, if you are expecting fancy additions, superfast UI, and other gimmicks, this isn't for you. Yes, it is expensive but it is an expensive E-READER.

My Kindle 5 of 7+ years finally died and I needed to upgrade. But I wasn't too keen on a purely touchscreen device as I am too used to having page-turner buttons. So, even though the new PW is 'newer', I went for this one.

PROS
- Metal body - solid and premium feel, comfy to hold
- The bump - unlike most people, I actually enjoy holding the device with the bump and I use a sleeve instead of a cover. It helps me hold the Kindle for long without any fatigue.
- The page-turner buttons - Don't get me wrong, coming from a button-only Kindle, the ease of a touchscreen on Kindle feels amazing but those page-turner buttons mean that I can disable touchscreen and read without the fear of accidental touching.
- The screen - I could write a ballad on the clarity (esp after a 7+ year upgrade). The screen is just a beaut.

CONS (of course, it is not perfect)
- Battery life - While you don't need to charge it daily, the Oasis does drain faster than your average Kindle. But if you read on Flight Mode, you can definitely extend the battery life.
- Micro USB - Again, you do not have to charge it all day but you do need a micro USB. When Amazon refreshed its PW line last year, it could really have just released an updated Oasis with USB-C and/or wireless charging. For frequent travellers, it means one more cable. It is not a deal-breaker but can be annoying.
- No Bluetooth - Indian Kindles still do not have Bluetooth connectivity for Audible, so that's just a loss of feature. Again, not a deal-breaker.
- Lack of accessories in India - For some reason, there are very few third-party covers/sleeves available on Amazon for the Oasis. And among the ones that are, the good ones are too expensive while the cheap ones are just bad. (One may say that if you are spending so much on the device, might as well shell out money for the cover but meh, I am cheap)

Finally, just a general observation. Kindles should have a Pocket integration by now (Like Kobo does). While no-interruption reading is the goal, Pocket articles also count towards reading and needs to be added."
sunny,Good product but dishonest marketing,"I have migrated from physical books to tablet and finally from tablet to kindle. I found e reading to be better than physical books because of inbuilt dictionary, backlight feature, for the ability to carry your library everywhere you go, and for the ability to change font style and size. When i migrated to kindle a month ago I was reluctant to invest around 20k into this when i already had mobile and tablet, only plus point I found in kindle back then was its matte screen which makes it readable like paper in sunlight, something you can't do in tab or mobile. So i finally ordered this and man my reading speed and time has increased. Not only i can read well in sunlight but it puts considerably less strain on my eyes, i never really realised before using kindle that I'm getting tired not because of my brain capacity but because of the strain lcd display causes from a close distance. I'm very happy with the product except two things. The touchscreen is nothing like lcd screen, its slow, sometimes irresponsive and sometimes times it's response is wrong, like you're trying to highlight one line and device is wrongfully picking up the line above. As much as this is a problem, in a few days you'll get accustomed to it and it will stop bothering you. Has it been just this issue i would have given this device 5 stars but there is another problem, the battery. The battery, in my experience is just ordinary, nothing exceptional like the company tells you. I usually read for around 3 hours a day and it lasts for 2 to 2.5 days for me, and I've read for a few days without backlight, ie, with zero brightness (under tubelight or in sunlight) and I didn't notice much difference in battery backup. And I also must mention here that I always use my kindle in airplane mode. So battery is really not anything to promote in this device, its just average, worse than most mobiles and tablets of this generation. Other than that I'm very happy with the device and will most definitely recommended it to all those who read around or more than a dozen books in a year, if you read like one or two books in a year then this device won't be economical for you considering its price."
Suresh K,Paperwhite + Features = Oasis!,"There is no color in this gen was a complaint in one of the reviews, but if you see the high end phones these days have a ""reading mode"" that Eliminates the color altogether to give a monochromatic effect.
Which in my perspective is good for the eyes, after having migraines reading on my smartphone.
The cost is high, could have reduced a bit.!
The aesthetics are too good feels solid to hold on to, page orientation changes automatically when you change hands. The aluminum body feels solid, the glass display is good. LEDs power up the screen to soothe the eyes. Auto adjusted.
Physical buttons are a plus, since my mom uses the kindle and she's old gen.
The UI is quite slow, doesn't mean it's non-responsive E Ink screens are ideal for displaying black and white text, can’t display colors and have a slow refresh rate. The big benefit to an E Ink screen, is the way text appears on it. E Ink screens are advertised as “electronic paper"" they look more similar to paper than typical LCD screens do.
If you want the features of a smartphone get the phone not this E-Reader.
There is a user manual or guide in the kindle store, read before use to locate the settings. Well I didn't read instead I liked to explore around and all you have to do is click on the button that looks like a gear round in shape and says ""settings""
For a premium E-Reader kindle subscription price could have been reduced.
Will update the battery status after use supposed to last weeks after charging.
In my opinion Paperwhite is a good budget friendly version with few features cut.

Cons : For this cost you don't get a leather pouch along, or a reduced subscription fee, and could have given 3 books for free.

Update:
Cons:
So batter drains when connected to WiFi or if you use the 3G version, a quick research and found that battery are not upgraded in any E-Reader kindle or Kobo, Amazon says the kindle lasts weeks but in the disclaimer it says with a half an hour usage per day.

Pros:
The 12 LEDs power up and my eyes are never hurt these days, when using a phone they hurt.
The warm light can be adjusted.
The aesthetics and feels solid in hand comfortable.
Kindle unlimited subscription gives you a world of books.

The 2019 Paperwhite is a better choice without extra led and it's pocket friendly."
Dipayan Dasgupta,It was a great experience but,The screen got damaged and now I have to buy a new one for replacement. I apologise for my bad words. It may have happened due to magnetic cover. I will buy kindle again but not this expensive one. I LOVE KINDLE DEVICE SOOO VERY MUCH
Yesudas Gadda,Not upto my expectations,"Long back I purchased kindle 8.9 HD fire. Recently I have purchased one more. In every aspect first one was an amazing kindle device. I purchased more than 250 books. I felt great when I was reading. Kindle 8.9 HD fire gave me a wonderful feeling that I was reading great books. But present new kindle oasis 10 generation 32GB cannot be compared with the kindle 8.9HD fire. It’s not giving the feel of reading. Tablet size is not giving the feel of reading. I think serious readers may not feel comfortable if they want to read hours together. Rather than kindle device, kindle App can serve the purpose in a very good way. I expect a very good kindle device like kindle 8.9HD fire in future."
,Excellent device! Chose it over new paperwhite,"I had waited a long time for the new gen Kindle to launch and it finally did. Amazon launced 11th gen paperwhite in the last quater of 2021. Now this was competing with the Oasis on terms of the features it offered. Paperwhite is priced well and offers a massive battery advantage over all Kindle device. Add to that the USB C charging and wireless charging. So, if you were to carry your Kindle while travelling and often find yourself away from the charger for weeks together, then it is a no brainer, just go buy Kindle paperwhite 11 gen. But my requirements were different.

1. I was only interested in 8gb model. Since audible is not supported on Kindle in India, with 8gb I could store years worth of books.
2. I read mostly at home, about 1-2 hours on an avarage. So, charger type or a week long backup was not a problem to me.
3. I prefer to read mostly on bed and one handed. So buttons on the device were welcome. Also the ability to switch hands with auto rotating screen is very handy.
4. Auto brightness is a feature that I didn't want to ignore. Note: 8gb paperwhite doesn't have auto brightness.

With the above in mind I had two choices, the 11 gen 32gb paperwhite or 8 gb Oasis. At the time of buying both were priced at 17,999 INR. I decided to go with the Oasis.

The battery lasts little more than a week. I usually keep the device in airplane mode. Had no problem charging the device. Absolutely enjoying the reading experience! Not to mention the premium feel of the device and excellent ergonomics."
Shujath,Recommended,"Initially, I thought of buying a 6'' minimal feature version then I decided to buy this as it will be a one-time investment. Now, after using it for six months I can say that I made the right decision otherwise I would be missing many special features we have in Oasis, particularly the bigger screen, hard buttons, backlight and screen rotation.

Speaking about the pros,
1. Total eye-friendly. You will enjoy reading on it, no matter day or night (dark). There won't be any light reflections.
2. Battery life is fair and will not bother you. As per my calculations, it was ten days with wifi enabled and twenty days with Airplane mode for an average reading time of 40-60min per day.
3. You can hold the kindle over the screen by disabling the touch screen and flipping pages with hard buttons.

Cons:

1. The most difficulty I faced is reading while on bed i.e upside down. You can't hold kindle properly in that position. Amazon should redesign its product considering this factor. I pasted the pop-out socket holder on the back which helped me a lot in holding kindle in any position (see attached image).
2. The auto-brightness and warmth of the screen are not as expected. I made it manual to get rid of improper brightness.
3. The material cost of this product is too high. They should lower it so that more people can make use of it. Since other competitors like Kobo are not in the Indian market, they are enjoying the monopoly.

I was not a vivid reader before, but now I am building a habit. It is now my lifelong partner and sometimes a sleeping pill as well :)"
,Glare,Is it me or anyone else feel the fonts are not sharper and there is glare
Bob12241,This is my favorite gadget,if I get lost on an island and I’m allowed to take only one thing with me. I’m taking this. I know some people will say phone but there is only one person I talk to on my phone and they will be going with me so I don’t need the phone. Kindle will be my answer!
Rebekka,Must for Voracious readers,"If we do a direct feature comparison of Oasis with a paperwhite, it has hardly any difference in that aspect compared to the massive price tag on oasis. So someone who reads occasionally they should definitely go with paperwhite or even a basic kindle as a matter of fact.

Now coming to the real audience for this device that is the voracious readers the selling point for you guys is that it is very light and the lightest kindle out there, it has page turn buttons which are so easy to use instead of tapping away on the screen straining or fingers for every page to be turned, it has an ergonomic design so it's very easy to hold and even if you use the oasis with a cover it is very easy to hold.
This is it , just this much is the difference of an Oasis with any other kindle even the newer ones, but it matters as we read lots and lots of books these small details start playing a larger role"
Indian,Don't buy this if you want to read PDF's .,"The PDF reading experience is really next to awful... If you are looking for a device to read PDF just look somewhere else with screen size 9 in or higher ...even 7.9-inch e-readers make a difference than this one...

If the format is epub or Mobi then you are blessed...in case of properly edited epub I can easily convert it with calibre to .mobi and the images and tables are nicely edited...the flow is great and a massive treat to your reading experience if you are buying books from amazon then you are on the 3rd world the experience is just wow...

but people buy this only for its extra 1-inch size not for any other useless feature like waterproof or 32 GB (27gigs available) or whisper sync page-turn buttons or 300 PPI a kindle basic of 6k would suffice if you are not planning to read ""MORE PDF's""

The zoom feature is another awful mess you can zoom from

1.No zoom/Original
2.4x zoom
3.8x zoom
4.16x zoom
5 32x zoom

they should have either added a 2x zoom or should have added something for cropping the PDF since most PDF's has more margins...a crop out of margins would yield a highly focussed view of your files...

The only way is to read the PDF is to view them in landscape mode which requires you to scroll the single page up and down and that requires more time with the device to memorise the touch response to your fingers..."
Sabarish Waran,The best available,"There was a persistent thought that I should wait as Amazon might release a newer version this year end. Secondly though everyone is just recommending to go with the 6.8"" paperwhite, still this is very special kindle.

1. First it has that hump to hold things. It is slipper but better than nothing
2. Physical turn buttons. That is the key to next level experience
3. By putting it in landscape mode it works wonders. Feels like you are using a different device all together with hump at the bottom.
4. Good backlight. Useful as we are moving from outside to inside of home with different light/brightness conditions.

Got it in prime day sale, which made it affordable. It is definitely overpriced.

I have kindle keyboard from 10 years back and the difference in proper day light between two is not astounding. Just marginal clarity difference and then ofcourse there is backlight and hump to hold. Overall worth upgrading if you have very old kindle."
,Not supported all books,"1) There are many books, I want to read but Kindle not supported those. This is big drawback. Made me Unhappy.

2) Loading or Buffering time is lengthy which may make you bore if you habituated with fast process.

3) With Wifi Battery life is not more than 15 Days.

4) PDF zooming out/in will disappoint you.

5) Other all are Ohk and Good."
Madan Mohan,"Nice purchase,though there are plenty rooms for improvement","I liked this kindle a lot.Lets first approach the pros.
1.The page turn buttons feels like using a book.
2. the yellow or warm light is very soothing for eyes.I never turn it off.
3. other than kindle store books,you can import .mobi files & .docx files.Reading experience with these two file formats are really great.
lets go through the cons.
1.battery like is weak. maybe it is for the warm light which i keep always on. but on my moderate to low usage battery drains from 100 to 5 percent in 7 days.
2. audible and bluetooth function is missing in indian version.They didnot gave a mere text to speech engine.
3. i bought it on sale( Oasis 10th Gen with warm light,8GB,WIFI) & it costs 18999.I think price must be a it lower,it must lie around 15k bracket.Though i dopnt regret the purchase as i get 10 % discount as pay balance and 10% sbi card discount;which brought its price in 15k category.

There are something which you can do to get the most of the kindle.First thing,install save to kindle extension or app.Just google it & you will realise what a life saver it can be. Also there is a screenshot function in oasis by just tapping two opposite corners simultaneously.

thats all folks. i dont have to think much as it has 1 year warranty with free replacement. buy it,read a lot, you will love it.And in the meanwhile,pl;s irritate amazon in social media handles to provide audible support in upcoming updates."
Ajay Jakhar,If you can not open /read all books that you bought from amazon,"🤔🤔Kya fayda agar app apni saari books
nahi padh sakte kindle device par kiyonki device support nahi karti...jab kindle pe app support karti hai to kindle device ko aisa kiyo nahi banaya ki saari books padh sake ...joki sirf books ke liye hai ....to fayeda kya kindle device khareedne ka....

Meri bus ek hee request hai ki
Please Next kindle device update aisa ho atleast saari book to padhi jaa sake otherwise ...ye to bus dikhawe ka item hee hai..bus.....😏😏"
Riju Sarkar,"Easy handling ,operatability, great look ,style",Amazing product
Lightningstorm02,Can be better,"Kindle Oasis is innovative yet is filled with pitfalls. The major one is tiny black dots all over the screen. The battery life is very pathetic. Doesn't last ""for weeks"" as claimed by the manufacturer. It merely lasts even a full day i.e. if not on Wi-Fi. If you use Wi-Fi, it will last max 15-16 hours if you read for 6-7 hours. My first unit was very poor. After I returned and ordered a new one, the same problem persists of ""black dots"" and poor battery.

Pros :

1) Good for reading. No competition as Koba is not widely available and used in India
2) Doesn't strain the eyes even after extended usage
3) Good metal back. Feels premium.
4) Font feature best of any electronic device till date.

Cons:

1) Pathetic battery
2) Screen not crisp and annoying to look at because of permanent black dots riddled all over it.
3) Poor Quality control as it is manufactured in China and dust particles are on the bottom of the screen below the display and sides on both the units tested.
4) Audiobook feature not available.
5) Not worth INR 20,999 (Wi-Fi 32 GB model). It should be priced at a maximum of INR 10,000 - 12,000 looking at the Quality control and Chinese manufacturing. On full price, not even worth looking at. (when not on sale)

Overall, I am quite disappointed. Will give it 2.7 out of 5."
Puneet,Good for reading books with perfect brightness and feel,I really love my Kindle Oasis. I am enjoying reading the books the brightness the colour everything is perfect. It feels like I am reading a real book the colour and texture in the pages make me feel that way. The only thing I I want you to be added in future versions is that it does not have voice typing option in the keyboard. Aur even if I could add keyboard like in Android by installing third-party keyboard that would have been great because they allow to voice type. As now I'm really using voice type in most of the time on phones and even in my laptop. One other thing I want is it's such a costly and fine piece of technology though still in does not have 5ghz network support. downloading a single book on 2ghz does not take much time. But downloading multiple books or synchronisation of multiple books at time then 5ghz would have lot faster and convenient. One more thing to add I am ok with hand holding it by one hand but if there was some option for stand in the cover provided by Amazon or some maybe mechanism which made it support on desk easily for hold easily then I would have given 5 stars
Anji.A,Great product from Amazon,"This is my 5th kindle, I am big fan of Kindle, love' it"
,"Best there is, but","I bought it on a Prime Day offer for Rs.17,999. 8gb wifi only variant. There is no use buying a 32gb model since Audible support is not available in India. 8gb is enough to hold thousands of books.
This variant of the kindle is the most premium offered by Amazon, the body looks and feels premium. It is fully made of metal. The design is ergonomic and stacked on one side making it easy to hold.
the screen is of 7-inch which feels like a real book and I like the shape of the screen its more closer to a book. the screen has a very good pixel density so it is very sharp even if you use a very low font size.
the Oasis comes with warm light which does make quite a difference while reading at night. the screen can get very bright has 25 LEDs compared to Paperwhites 5.
The battery life is quite good and it easily lasts a week under a long session of reading. I have come across many reviews which have said the battery life lesser than the Paperwhite but I didn't find any problems with that.
The page turn buttons are customizable and it's a very convenient way to turn the pages. It can be used by either hand, the page automatically turns around.
It's a great choice BUT it depends on you how much it matters to you because apart from the big screen, warm lighting, page turn buttons the rest are the same features with the Paperwhite which is almost Rs.8000 cheaper than Oasis. The screen on both the Oasis and Paperwhite are of the same resolution, both are waterproof. You won't go wrong with either of the two devices."
Shrabandip Mahanta,"Great device for reading, no doubt, but Amazon packing of this expensive device is HORRIBLE!!","Device is definitely great for reading books, I've been reading alot after getting Kindle and I bought because of 7 inch screen and buttons, I don't use warm light very much, battery is decent isn't great,I read for 2 - 3 hrs a day so I charge once a week, with power adapter you can charge device in less than an hour, so that's very helpful, I had some issue with first device so Amazon replaced it without much hassle, my biggest issue is with how Amazon packed this expensive fragile device, it was careless to be honest, I could see a dent on the package, thankfully device was fine, but I request Amazon to pack things more carefully with more bubble wrap I guess, it had no bubble wrap at all, I bought Hard cover of a book recently am just scared now how Amazon will pack the book as it's 10 anniversary edition of Mistborn trilogy, packing gotten worse lately

As for the device, device is great for reading 8 gb is more than enough and easy to hold, I bought with black fabric cover, this device definitely needs the magnetic cover to protect as we don't have much choice, fabric cover is of good Material I have no complaints with cover"
,Ovarall product is good however the price is little bit higher,"The UI is very slow ( though it should not be bothering you because you're only reading in it , not playing a game or something lol) . I shifted from Kindle 7th generation to this oiasis 10th generation, it looks like the battery draining rate is faster in oiasis than kindle , in 1 full charge I can read upto 2 and half or 3 days. However in. Kindle I used to charge once in a week . The mat finished design is so primium and it is easy to hold. The page turning buttons and the auto adjustable brightness are really helpful. Though there is a dark mode however I don't like it (personal choice) .
However overall the price is slightly high ... I have the 32 gb wifi varient it took 24999 INR , which should be 18000-20000 INR"
Krishna,Definitely worth it,I got my kindle 2 months ago I was doubting at the beginning if the upgrade was worth it but I can tell now it is . This kindle accepts PDF documents also so I don’t have to change the format to be able to read it and only because if that I’m extremely happy. The books with graphics are also with a great quality to read ñ. I recommend the upgrade.
,Device is for real readers! OneAssist is worst addon.,"Don't listen to negative reviews. The device is awesome. This is not for people who haven't read atleast a few books. You need to be a reader first then only you can enjoy the device. Its amazing to hold, lighter in weight than even the small mobile phone. Big screen than mobile phone - overall wonderful experience to read just like a book. We can adjust font, carry more books, kindle unlimited for free books, dictionary, searching within books, notes - so many features we wont get in a physical book. Lighter than mobile phones, no eye-straining, comfortable hold even when you are lying down, distraction free are the advantages over mobile phones and tablets.

That said, I purchased OneAssist plan for 1699. When trying to activate, OneAssist people told me that the plan is not for this model of Kindle. However in Amazon they sell with explicitly mentioning One Assist protection plan for 1699 is for this model. I lost 1699 in between Amazon and OneAssist. So don't purchase OneAssist plan at all - its total bakwaas."
AAYMADEEP R PRADHAN,good start,"Its been more than 2 weeks since I started using Kindle Oasis. This is my first kindle purchase and so I cant compare the other models to Oasis.
Usability: It is comfortable and easy to use.
Product: New Product.
Features:
Pros:
1.Almost all the features mentioned in the Tech Specs works well.
2. Settings - lighting, brightness works well.
3. Page turn button is my all time favourite.
4. Works well with Kindle format books

Cons:
1. The PDF format books are not easy to read.
2. The kindle font settings doesnt apply to PDF."
,Rekindle your reading experience!,"Awesome device for avid readers. It feels overpriced but it can hold 100s of books. For 8 gb device you get around 6gb space. Also kindle format books are little cheaper as compared to paper back so in the long run you save money on books. You will like it if you are fan of bigger screen. But it won't fit in your pocket as the paperwhite does. Also it has few useful enhancements over the previous devices.

Auto screen rotation - is helpful when you change hands to hold the device
Auto brightness - good feature like smart phone but consumes more battery
Physical turn buttons - you can turn off touch and use the physical buttons to turn pages. It's really helpful
Warm led lights - good for night reading

I have experienced battery drain issues initially but turning on the aeroplane mode as well as turning off the auto brightness feature saves the battery. Also I had to hard reboot the device once by long pressing the power button. Now the device lasts for about one and half to two weeks with about 40 minutes of reading every day. Also in week ends I read more about 1.5 to 2 hours. I am liking it and am not regretting my purchase."
Kindle Customer,Great Kindle but the battery life is not as promised,"The Kindle is very cool and the champagne colour is good too. its very easy to use and the features are all good. I like this seize of the kindle and its easy to hold and read.
the touch screen is good so far.
what i dont like is the battery life. everyone claims that Kindle battery lasts for weeks but mine is max 3 days. Yes, i read for hrs non stop but still the battery life should have been better.
therefore 4 stars"
Sindhu,better experience than paperwhite,"I've had kindle 2 to kindle paperwhite models and oasis 10th gen is by far the best reading experience I've had in a long time! I am an audiobook kind of person. I have over 500 hours of listening on Audible and am very pleased that this kindle supports audiobooks!

BUT the only downside the kindle doesn't have a sleep timer for audiobooks so good luck putting that audiobook and snoozing. Also you cannot listen to podcasts you have added on Audible app on the kindle."
Prasad,Great Product who reads a lot,"I was using the old kindle which I could not use in the dark, but with I can even read without turning on the lights. Overall very happy with product."
Hari,Fantastic device for avid readers,"I upgraded to this from a basic Kindle, and I'm absolutely blown away!

Before I begin, though, I must say that the Oasis is an indulgence, and the Paperwhite and the Kindle basic do the job equally well. But if you read extensively, and if reading is your primary leisure time activity, it's definitely worth looking into.

Here's what I love about the Oasis:

1. Bigger Screen: This makes more difference than you would think. I find it sized like a small paperback, and it makes the reading experience pleasant. There is also the advantage of more words per page, and lesser turns.

2) Ergonomics: There is a side panel with page turn buttons, and you can just rest your thumb comfortably between the buttons, while gripping the slight bulge at the back with your palm. If you want to change your hand, you flip the device device upside down, and the text also gets flipped. This makes one-handed reading very comfortable.

3) Screen and lighting: The screen is super sharp and very easy on the eyes. I generally do not use the lighting at daytime, and find it very comfortable even in sunlight. The device's light comes in handy in low lighting environments, and with the new warmth feature, you can now customize the tint of the lighting as well. I find the yellowish tint to be more pleasant for night reading."
Pavi,Kindle Oasis: Best eReader that’s There,"My first Kindle device and I wanted to have something that would last for next few years without getting outdated. So Oasis (32 GB, without 3 or 4G) fits the Bill, a bit costlier though. I understand the design specs, so would have loved it to have the colour display too. May not be always needed, but colour would have given a new life to comics and illustrations; not sure how that would have impacted the technical specs of battery life, screen design but I am sure it was manageable (Pebble managed a watch screen akin to this in colour way back in 2015 with 7 days battery life). Other feature being IP68 compliant is absolutely necessary with any electronic device, we are well into 21st century. Battery life is great, auto screen brightness and warmth adjustments are good, even bit of browsing on its browser is good. I may be expecting too much, but if Amazon would have incorporated Bluetooth connectivity and functionality for Audible (I am sure, Amazon would be having the model ready and is saving it for future release), we would have had the choice to decide."
Dinesh Kulkarni,Kindle Oasis 10th Generation is my new buddy!!,"Kindle Oasis 10th Generation with Wifi and 32GB is a fantastic reading buddy. Amazon service is super lightening fast. the package was extremely neat and well protected. In fact I was indicated delivery by 22nd March but was surprisingly delivered by 15th March,2020. Product cost me Rs.24999 which I believe totally value for money. Its beautiful champagne gold coloured. I have yet to explore all the features though I could quickly got familiarised with few important ones. It has smooth navigation and access to my goodreads library. The most attractive feature that I found was the highlight of the book wherein you get to know a lot about the book, you can highlight important aspects of the book as you read, vocabulary builder is just amazing, power usage is good though its too early for me to comment on it. I would certainly provide another review after a month or so to provide more elaborate observations. The kindle unit is very premium looking, easy to handle, feature on warmth is good and easy on eyes. Overall, would recommend to anyone who want to go on reading spree without accumulating hard copy books and also want to get lot more from reading and who is willing to part with some extra dime for the permium version of Kindle.. Kindle Oasis 10th Generation with 7"" premium screen!!..."
Sarah T,Battery issues,Everything seems good about the kindle oasis but when it comes to battery life it doesn’t even last for a week and it refused to charge to a 100% always hovering over the 98% mark . I tried all the suggestions from the online forum where many had the same issue to no avail . I read for an average of about 3 hours a day and I had to charge it every few days . Must say the paper white had a much better battery .. where I would recharge my kindle after two weeks given the time spent with my kindle was the same After speaking to customer service and reading several reviews online i purchased a new oasis and have requested for a return and refund of this kindle . Keeping my finger crossed that this battery is better and does justice to the exorbitant cost of the oasis ! I bought the oasis as a treat to myself for all the reading I do but was very disappointed with the battery .
V. Sridhar,A great reading device - the best Kindle,"The Kindle Oasis is the best Kindle, although I think it is over-priced. It has some improvements, such as the feature that allows the device to reorient the text if it is flipped upside down. More storage space is another advantage. Despite the proliferation of Kindles it is strange that Amazon still does not have a dedicated support system for users. I had to deal with a glitch in Amazon's systems that created problems while using the Send-to-Kindle feature. Strangely, even after a week Amazon's staff were unable to offer me a solution from the pesky requirement of having to ""verify"" every single document that I was trying to. send to the Oasis. After multiple attempts, over several days, I found the ""solution"" by deregistering all my other devices. Surely, users expect better from Amazon. In fact, it is difficult to even engage with Amazon support on this issue. Amazon should address this issue on a priority basis."
Rohan,Read the complete honest review.,"So here, finally I bought the Kindle Oasis after thinking which one to buy out of all the Kindle.
1) Product quality:- The quality of the product is beautiful. It does feel like paper as they claim. But that's just about the physical quality. 9/10
2) Touch screen performance:- To be honest, it's not that great. The touch is delayed by seconds and there's even black and white flicker when we do any action or turn the screen around. It does not feel worth it for paying Rs. 21,999. 3/10
3) Overall product performance:- Battery is quite good. Last for weeks. Just not that happy with the touch screen. It does not feel worth paying the amount.
You can adjust reading on very good tablet in the same amount rather than a kindle.
Thus, think twice, experience the kindle if possible without buying it. Or if buying, go for a lower version of Kindle and not this one."
