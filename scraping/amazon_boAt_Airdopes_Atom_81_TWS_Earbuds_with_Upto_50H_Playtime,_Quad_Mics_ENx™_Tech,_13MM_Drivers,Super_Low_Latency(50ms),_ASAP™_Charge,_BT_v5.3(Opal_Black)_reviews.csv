Rakesh,Average Product,"The boAt Airdopes Atom 81 True Wireless Earbuds have some good features, and also have a few drawbacks. Overall, this is an average choice for those looking for affordable wireless earbuds.

Starting with the positives, the sound quality of these earbuds is quite good. The audio is clear and balanced, with decent bass. I enjoyed listening to music and watching videos with these earbuds, as they provided an immersive experience.

The battery life is another positive aspect of the boAt Airdopes Atom 81. The earbuds themselves can last for around 4-5 hours on a single charge, which is decent for their price range. The charging case also provides additional battery life, allowing for multiple charges on the go.

In terms of design, the earbuds are compact and lightweight, making them comfortable to wear for extended periods. They fit securely in my ears and didn't fall out during activities like jogging or workouts. The touch controls on the earbuds are also easy to use and responsive.

However, there are a few downsides to consider. Firstly, the connectivity of these earbuds can be a bit inconsistent. I experienced occasional dropouts and interruptions in the audio, especially when moving around or being in crowded areas. This can be frustrating at times.

Another drawback is the lack of noise cancellation or isolation. These earbuds do not provide any significant noise reduction, so external sounds can still be heard while using them. This can be a disadvantage for those who prefer a more immersive and isolated listening experience.

Additionally, the build quality of the charging case feels a bit flimsy. It doesn't have a premium feel and may not withstand rough handling or accidental drops.

Overall the boAt Airdopes Atom 81 True Wireless Earbuds are a decent option for those on a budget. They offer good sound quality, decent battery life, and a comfortable fit. However, the connectivity issues, lack of noise isolation, and average build quality of the charging case are factors to consider. If you're willing to compromise on these aspects, these earbuds can be a suitable choice for everyday use."
Very nice product to purchase,Detailed review below,"Ok, so what to say about this Airdopes I am confused about giving it a 3 or 4 rating. This is the Airdopes which is not liked by many Also, this is my second time buying so I am reviewing it after using it for about 1 and a half years and I am using its 2nd set. Yes, 1st set already stopped working within 1 year, so let's divide it into pros and cons: 1) Pros i. You get a good boat signature sound not so loud and very heavy bass very soothing for the ears and this is the only main reason why I buy it again. ii. I prefer the design of earbuds without rubber or in ear design it fits well in my ears. iii. Budget-friendly actually sometimes at sale available at 800rs.
2)Cons i. As I told you earlier one earbud stopped working within 1 year so it didn't last so long. ii. The build quality is not that really good. iii. I also face bad experience at service centre so if its not working then the physical state of the product should be intact then only they provide service. iv. Battery life is not as claimed it lasts upto 10 hours only. v. Sometimes auto connectivity doesn't work. So, choose accordingly."

Vijay,Good noise cancellation for calls but average sound and very low bass quality,"- I got a faulty product on first delivery - left bud was not responding to touch inputs, but after replacement I got working pair.
- As its half ear buds it does not fit in ears properly, but that is expected. This is only suitable for indoor use, at least for me, because if you use this outdoor the buds might fall off and may get lost.
- Call quality is excellent for the price range. Noise cancellation can remove most of the background noises and focus on our voice in scenarios like a song playing through laptop speakers, filling a bucket of water, ceiling fan at full speed and typing noise to an extent.
- However music quality is only average, It has good treble (high tones) but bass is very bad. Even at 50 percentage volume we can hear distortions on bassy sounds. But I purchased this for calls so it is ok for me.
- Battery life is good, I used it to listen to music for a maximum of 2 hours at around 40 to 50 percent volume and the remaining battery of the earbuds were at 50 percentage. So I assume the buds alone could give about 4 hrs in a single charge without the case.
- Range is not that great when there are walls in between. It can hardly pass 1 room with a wall in between which is like 10 meters in total, but you can always carry the phone in your hands or pocket.
- Look, touch and feel is not premium. It feels plastic and cheap. But for the price point of ‚Çπ999 I think it is expected.
- The mic didn't work for me in Ubuntu 22.04. I mean the Hands free profile is not working in Ubuntu, you cannot see this mic in the list of input devices. So the mic of this buds do not work out of the box in Ubuntu, I could not get it to working even with some tinkering.
- The buds are totally splash proof or water resistant. It can be washed on tap water. When its wet the sound will be distorted but when it dries the sound will become normal, however it cannot or must not be immersed in water (I have not tried it). I took a bath with this on and I also wash it when it gets ear wax and it is still working fine."
Nidhin,Great product,"The sound quality of the product is just awesome. And it is the product which is value for money which has also good battery backup. The only disadvantage is I can‚Äôt use the product for long time, whenever I start using the product for more than 2hours my ears will start paining due to the design at the mesh of the product."
,Gaming and fitting in ears,"According to me atom 81 is best eardopes in this price range. Build quality is amazing and everything is fine, but if u have small ears like me then you can go with other earbuds, coz it's difficult to fit it in small ears and also gaming experience is almost good. You can purchase it if u've normal or big ears."
srivathsa,"Decent product for the price, but the build quality should have been better","Decent sound. Easy to operate. But it's not a snug fit for the ear, keeps slipping off. So I cant use it while driving or while running. Also, the lid feels like it would break very easily. The build quality and design should have been better."
Harsh FF,not good for calling while traveling,"the product built quality was average ,but the sound quality was awesome but sometimes there was issue with pairing any one side of ear bud disconnects automatically and it's a big no for calling purpose mainly while traveling because the person on the other side will not receive the voice properly while traveling and ENx is not so effective and charging speed was good and battery life was also good üëç"
,Honest review after 6months of use,"I'm using it from the last 6monts and never faced a problem with it. It's sound is amazing at it was in the beginning just have faced some issues related to connecting 1more thing that theairpod case is very shiny that it catches scratches
It's battery life is also amazing. One problem with it is that sometimes when charge continuosly it heats very much (not all time but somewhere)"
Krishnamurthi Kumar,Quite good,This are good enough but some time the one of the two pairs are not just a pairing but the noise are came out and product were not that much of useful
Preksha,Average product,"Okay so, it's been around 7 months since I ordered it and it's sound quality was good
Sometimes it didn't connect but that was okay
But the mesh of its speaker was always ready to come out
And now it's finally the mesh of the left airpode is lost on it's own as I never tried to remove the mesh but I noticed it yesterday that it was gone
Now it won't last long as the dirt will enter in the speaker
I expected it to last for atleast 1 yearüòï"
