Wrickzy,A overall good product but seemingly incompetent due to irregular battery and charging pattern,"I have tried several earbuds in the <1500Rs price segment and without a doubt it is a good earbud for the price you pay but it has its own set of pros and cons. So, without further ado the pros and the cons of the product according to me are: (** marked points are important features/downsides of this earphone)
Pros:
**1. Sound and Bass: The sound and bass of this earbud are exceptionally good for the price. The sound and the bass can even be tuned by an EQ to suit your audio needs from your phone but in windows, I still haven't found a way to change EQ without using some third party software.
2. Waterproof: Yes it is water proof but up to a certain water level and for a certain duration.
3. Design: This point is debatable for this earbud because of its large upper part. Though it sits comfortably in your ear but it has a tendency to come loose due to certain jerking of the head.
**4. Battery backup of each earbud: By far the best thing for this earbud. The battery backup is impressive. Even after using it for 6hrs at 60% volume, the battery remaining was 40%. The battery remaining percentage is shown both in mobiles as well as in windows.
5. Codecs: It supports both SBC and AAC codecs but switching to AAC codec will rapidly deplete your phone's battery (if you are on android especially).
6. USB C charging and digital display for remaining charge: Though it is of mere importance, but the digital display do provide an estimated percentage of charge remaining, while the LEDs used to power the display consume battery from the case. The USB C charging is a good feature though it takes around 30-45mins to charge the case fully.
7. Bluetooth connection: The connection is pretty fast. The fast pairing is also fast and after that you just need to open the case and take out the earbud and you are all set.

Cons:
1. Sound Distortion: At volume >90% you will definitely find the sound a bit distorted but this con can be overlooked as one wouldn't be using the earphone at that volume for long purposes.
**2. Case battery backup: This is the worst part of the whole earbud. It is claimed that the case offers an additional 32hours backup, but I found that the case was only able to charge both the earphones 1 time at max before having to charge the case again. So considering it charges both the earpods once, it comes down to 16hours of additional battery backup (effectively 8 hours if you use both of them at the same time)
3. Noise Cancellation: The earpods sounded great when I was using it in a less crowdy place (like a small room) than when used in place full of people and background noise (like travelling in a car/train/metro/bus etc). While travelling in a car, though I was using the earpod at about 90% of the maximum volume, still I could hear all outside noises and the bass and the sound of the playing song created a pandemonium.
**4. Charging the earbuds: Though the earbuds charge rather quickly once kept inside the case, but most of the times the case fails to recognize the earbuds. This is another serious issue of this earbud. I have 2 of these earbuds (in green and blue color) and both exhibit this same characteristic. You have to recheck whether it started charging or not every time you put an earbud inside the case because there is no guarantee that the case will recognize and start charging the earbud. Also, you will have to regularly clean the charge points of the earbuds and the case because even a pinch of dust can keep the case from recognizing the earbud (None of my other earbuds exhibited this problem). Also the earbud gets extremely hot when charging. So, you shouldn't immediately start using the earbuds right after charging.
**5.Mic: Although it has quad-mic system, I found the quality of the mic to be pretty bad. Also, you will have to speak louder for the person on the other end of the phone to actually hear you.

Conclusion: In conclusion, I would say that it is a decent buy if you are looking for an earbud under Rs1500. Considering the bass and sound it offers and also the battery of each earbud it provides, it is a value for money product."
Nidhin Kumar v b,..,"Good quality product, good sound quality and giving a bettery battery life"
,"clear sound but not better bass , good product","i love boat products , this product is good but bass is not high quality its normal , but audio quality is next level , i like this boat airdopes 121 pro tws earbuds"
gaurav,Did not meet the quality expectation,I used this product 3 times and every product has the same problem 'automatically gets disconnected frequently'. Had to return the product once cause it was not being connected. Now it has been only 1 month and only the single piece is working. Now I want to claim the warranty and I am unable to find the guidelines.
Amazon Customer,Basic level value for money,"I like this product very much because the quality is ok something seems to be better for the money so I have used it well and now it is fine but what is the problem once it fell down but once again I will use it again so don't worry value for money only If you want the basic level of features but what is missing, you can definitely buy it"
Hussain D V,"üéß boAt Airdopes 121v2: Initial Bliss, Longevity Questions üéß","üåü The boAt Airdopes 121v2 in-Ear True Wireless Earbuds, known for their initial allure, have faced a decline in performance over my year and a half of usage. This review highlights the journey from a promising start to a disappointing end.

Product Overview:
üéÅ In the package, the boAt Airdopes 121v2 includes the earbuds, additional ear tips, a charging cable, user manual, and warranty.

Initial Positives:
‚úÖ The initial experience was delightful, with impressive sound quality, lightweight design, and convenient multifunction controls.

Longevity Concerns:
‚ùå However, as time went on, the earbuds' performance deteriorated significantly. The audio quality became increasingly poor, and the connectivity issues worsened. Pairing took longer, and the overall experience suffered.

Pros:
üéµ Impressive sound quality in the beginning.
üï∫ Lightweight design for comfortable wear.
‚ú® Convenient multifunction controls.

Cons:
üîä Decline in audio quality over time.
üì∂ Connectivity issues increased.
‚è≥ Prolonged pairing time became frustrating.

Technical Details:
üîç The Airdopes 121v2 features a Bluetooth 5.0 connection and offers up to 14 hours of playback time with its 8mm drivers. The lightweight design and compatibility with mobile devices, laptops, and tablets add to its versatility.

The boAt Airdopes 121v2 True Wireless Earbuds had a promising beginning, but my experience over a year and a half has been marred by declining audio quality, connectivity challenges, and prolonged pairing times. While these earbuds offer great features, their longevity raises questions about their overall durability and value in the long run. üéßüï∞Ô∏èüì∂"

Raghavendra,Stylish and Functional Ear Buds,"I recently purchased these ear buds, and overall, I'm quite pleased with their performance. While they offer an excellent audio experience and a comfortable fit, there are a few aspects worth noting.

One of the standout features is the sound quality ‚Äì crisp, clear, and immersive. Whether I'm listening to music, taking calls in Teams/Webex meeting, or enjoying podcasts, these ear buds deliver an impressive audio experience. The battery life is also commendable, ensuring they last through long commutes or extended workout sessions without the need for frequent recharging.

However, there's a minor caveat that potential buyers should be aware of ‚Äì the color of the ear buds might be mistaken for a hearing aid. The sleek design is modern and minimalist, but the choice of color may draw unwanted attention or lead to the occasional misunderstanding. This aspect might be a deal-breaker for those who prefer more discreet earpieces.

Another point to consider is the initial difficulty in removing the ear buds from the case. At first, it can be a bit fiddly, requiring some patience and getting used to the mechanism. However, with time, I found that it becomes more intuitive, and the slight inconvenience is easily overcome.
The buds are little delicate. I happen to drop accidentally and the bud top layer opened up exposing the inner parts. However, I tucked it in and it still working, sigh.

On the positive side, the case itself is compact and portable, fitting easily into pockets or bags. The snug fit ensures that the ear buds are securely stored and charged whenever not in use. The charging speed is impressive, providing a quick top-up for those moments when you're on the go.

In conclusion, despite the initial challenges with the case and the potential confusion over the color, these ear buds are undeniably worth the price. The sound quality, comfortable fit, and overall functionality make them a solid choice for anyone in search of reliable wireless ear buds. If you can overlook the color concern and are willing to spend a little time getting accustomed to the case, these ear buds offer a great balance of style and performance."

Aman,Charging issue. Charges in parts.,Charging issue. Charges in parts. Initially getting charged upto 80% tapidly. But after that stops for long time. And after a long time it starts to recharge again and stops at 99% for more time and then goes on further to getting charged to 100%. I did this twice already to reconfirm. But the same things happened once again. Hence decided to return the item. If this is normal then Boat company MUST clarify this in their manual. Otherwise its quite abnormal behaviour. Can not be accepted in a brand new item.

Jinal,Average performance,The appearance of case is dull. The sound quality is also average just like 100rs. earphones. ENx is also not that much impressive. Battery life is also an issue I use for 2 to 2.5 hrs & its drain down to 30 from full charge. Otherwise sensors & fittings are good. Should improve the sound quality
