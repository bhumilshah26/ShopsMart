,"Looks stunning and working fine, Service & support is also good.","Looks stunning and working fine, found to be okay. But working only when connected to AC power and not working @battery. So escalated to their support team. Within two days, they sent their engineer for addressing the issue.

Received a brand new battery after a couple of days thro courier and issue was resolved.

Good going so far.. Kudos to their support."

Neeraj,Satisfying Product. Works well.,"Bought the item before one week. Within three(after order) days, received the product. It is working fine still now, no problem.

Due to the inefficiency of the application provided by the supplier(New Jaisa) warranty registration is not done. Please provide some useful links or way to complete the needed warranty registration.
It is better to give feedback about the product after the completion of warranty registration.

Thanks New Jaisa"

Newar Ben,Good buy but....,"I just received this piece and I was just amazed with it. The laptop looks brand new and everything is functioning well. However, the screen flickers to dark screen whenever I plug on or off the power cable. I don't know if this is normal or if it's just a faulty piece."
Vikram from Anantapur(AP),Refurbished i5 7th gen thinkpad,"It's a good buy, we can relay on Newjaisa without any hesitation."
,"Spotless from outside, multiple issues from inside","Ordered this cuz I wanted an upgrade to my i5 gen7 chipset for which I was happy to see this from outside. But reality hits you hard when you actually know something from inside. You'll realise within few hours of its usage that It's filled with plethora of problems ranging from disfunctional LAN for transmission and connectivity. Your screen flickers when you hover your cursor over the thumbnail of a video on YouTube. Issue with its fingerprint reader. And after a full charge, it's battery drops from 95% to 20% within 30 minutes. I've come across all of these nitty gritty problems within 1 hour of its usage. Honestly I would've found multiple other problems if I'd used it for longer. Requested for an exchange within 24 hours of its delivery, then due to its operational delay, had to opt for just a return to the seller."
Kamal Mehra,Seems worth it..,"For the amount I paid, it seems good value for money. Only issue seems to be battery which I am not sure will last for long. Also their warranty activation software provided on the system doesn't work effectively, got my warranty activated on call.. All in all, seems worth the money for the purpose I intend to use it for."

Placeholder,Battery issue.,I was well aware of the fact that this is a refurbished laptop so was not expecting it to be brand new either but wasn't expecting the battery to be in this bad condition. The battery drains from 100% to 0 in less than 10 minutes. I have to keep the charger plugged in at all times. Couldn't get the joy of working on this laptop while being a little away from a charging plug.
,Product and service are state of the art,Product and service are state of the art
Amardeep Singh,Looks like new one,"Mine is Lenvovo thinkpad with i5 7th gen processor and 8 gb ram. No scratch and so far battery backup is also. The seller is also giving 6 months warranty also. Doesnt look and feel like , it is an old one.
Will update my feedback , once I use it for bit longer time, but I feel there wont be any issue.Got it in 18k which is much cheaper than what local stores in my area."

mritunjay,Very good refurbished artfully from NewJaisa,"Everything is very good matching expectations just battery backup was not good initially (only 30 min), later after some charge discharge cycles, it started proving 1.5 hrs bacup which is good as refurbished laptop.
Scheduled technician visit for chrcking battery issue but he asked to check via servify which reported battery as ok and no help provided. Anyhow as battery backup increased later, I am happy with my decision."
