Vinay,Best Phone in this price range,"I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy M04 in the eye-catching Light Green color variant, and I must say I am quite impressed with what this budget-friendly smartphone has to offer. At a price of just 7499, it delivers a compelling combination of features that cater to the needs of everyday users.

Performance-wise, the Samsung Galaxy M04 is equipped with a MediaTek Helio P35 Octa-core processor, which handles day-to-day tasks and applications smoothly. The 4GB of RAM ensures multitasking is manageable, but what's interesting is the RAM Plus feature that allows users to utilize up to 8GB of RAM, providing extra headroom for demanding apps and games.

With 64GB of onboard storage, there's ample space to store your favorite apps, photos, videos, and more. In case you need additional storage, the phone also supports expandable storage via a microSD card.

The highlight of the Samsung Galaxy M04 is undoubtedly its long-lasting 5000mAh battery. For regular users, this battery capacity easily lasts a full day on a single charge, reducing the need to carry a charger around constantly. It's a relief to know that this phone won't leave you stranded with a dead battery when you need it the most.

Moving on to the camera capabilities, the Galaxy M04 sports a 13MP dual-camera setup, which captures decent photos in good lighting conditions. While it might not produce the same quality images as high-end flagship devices, it certainly suffices for social media sharing and general photography needs. The camera app offers some useful features like portrait mode and various filters to enhance your photography experience.

In terms of design, the Light Green color variant is refreshing and stands out from the usual black or white smartphones in the market. The phone's build quality feels solid, and the ergonomic design makes it comfortable to hold for extended periods.

On the software front, the Samsung Galaxy M04 runs on the company's One UI, which is known for its user-friendly interface and customizability. With the latest Android version pre-installed, you can expect a smooth and familiar user experience.

However, it's important to note that this phone might not be the best choice for heavy mobile gamers or those seeking cutting-edge performance, as it is more tailored for casual users with everyday needs.

In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green edition is an excellent option for anyone looking for a reliable and affordable smartphone. With its striking design, impressive battery life, and the option to expand RAM, it offers great value for money at a price point of 7499. Whether you are a student, a professional, or someone who just needs a dependable device for day-to-day tasks, the Galaxy M04 won't disappoint."

Placeholder,Good budget phone,Very good phone but it's a little slow but that's ok.
Placeholder,It’s good for the price you pay.,"I ordered this phone with exchange offer, got it for ~5,500 Rs. I was looking for an average phone for my mum. And this is just it.

Performance is average, smooth but slow; unexpected in a brand new phone. Camera quality is below average, but I don’t mind. Call quality is good so far. Battery life is good as well, but it’s only been 2 days.

What I don’t like is the app layout on Home Screen, and the interface design. It took me a while to get all the installed apps to Home Screen.

I didn’t face heating issues yet that some seem to complain. It’s a nice phone for an average user, a good one for the price."
Vishnu,Awesome,"The Samsung M04 offers a budget-friendly option with a 6.2-inch display, providing a decent viewing experience for its price point. Its performance is satisfactory for everyday tasks thanks to the Snapdragon processor and 3GB of RAM, though demanding apps or games might not run as smoothly.

The camera setup, featuring a dual-lens rear camera with a 13MP main sensor and a 2MP depth sensor, captures acceptable photos in well-lit conditions, but struggles in low light. The front-facing 5MP camera is suitable for basic selfies and video calls.

The device houses a 5,000mAh battery, which can easily last through a day of regular usage. However, charging is done through a micro-USB port, which might be a bit outdated for some users.

On the software side, the M04 runs Samsung's One UI on top of Android, providing a user-friendly experience and some customization options. As for storage, the 32GB internal storage can be expanded via microSD card for those who need more space.

In summary, the Samsung M04 is a decent budget smartphone that gets the basics done, but it's important to manage expectations given its limitations in terms of performance and camera quality, which are common trade-offs in this price range."
Ashwin,Good phone,"Good phone under budget
For grandparents this phone is best
Battery and other specifications are best"
Amazon Customer,Value for money,"Have been using the phone for past 1 year. Working as per the specification. Meets basic requirements of call, web browsing, social media use, etc., for a low end smartphone. Audio quality is very good for this low end mobile. RAM is low and so latency is using the phone. But that is fine as it is expected."
Mattjo,Negative Review: Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green,"The Samsung Galaxy M04 in Light Green may be budget-friendly, but it falls disappointingly short when it comes to camera performance. If you're someone who enjoys capturing life's moments with stunning clarity, this phone is bound to leave you feeling frustrated.

Camera Performance:
The 13MP primary camera on the Galaxy M04 struggles to produce satisfactory results, especially in anything less than optimal lighting conditions. Photos taken indoors or in low-light environments suffer from excessive noise and lack of detail. Even in well-lit settings, the colors appear muted, and the dynamic range is limited. The 5MP front camera is equally lackluster, producing selfies that lack sharpness and clarity. If you're a photography enthusiast, this phone simply won't meet your expectations.

Gaming Performance:
While the Galaxy M04 manages day-to-day tasks adequately, it's not designed for high-performance gaming. Graphically demanding games often suffer from lag and frame rate drops, making the gaming experience less enjoyable. If you're into heavy mobile gaming, you'd be better off considering a more powerful device.

Battery Life:
Although the 5,000mAh battery is impressive on paper, the subpar gaming performance drains the battery quickly during extended gaming sessions. While the phone may suffice for parents who use it for occasional tasks, the battery life may not last a full day under heavy usage scenarios.

Display:
The 6.3-inch HD+ LCD display is mediocre at best. While it gets the job done for casual media consumption, the lack of vibrant colors and average viewing angles fail to impress. The visual experience simply doesn't match up to other smartphones in this price range.

Software and Updates:
Samsung's One UI skin is generally user-friendly, but the budget nature of this phone means that major updates and feature enhancements might not be promptly delivered. This could lead to missing out on essential improvements and security patches.

Conclusion:
If you're a photography enthusiast or a heavy mobile gamer, the Samsung Galaxy M04 Light Green will be a major disappointment. The lackluster camera performance, subpar gaming capabilities, and average display make it unsuitable for users who prioritize these aspects. However, if you're a parent or a casual user who primarily needs a phone for basic tasks like calls, messaging, and light browsing, the Galaxy M04 might suffice. For anything more demanding, there are better options available in the market at a similar price point.

Pros:

Suitable for parents or casual users with basic needs
Affordable price point
Cons:

Subpar camera performance in various lighting conditions
Not suitable for high-performance gaming
Mediocre display quality
Potential delays in major software updates
Rating: 2.5/5"
Placeholder,Good,Accept at this price point
Abdul Muyeed,It's good purchasing for elders (40-50 years age group adults),"This is suitable for elders who only use phones for calls, videos, chatting, decent photos and long battery life according to them. By the way the sound quality is also good not too loud not too low decent sound according to them (elders). This phone is not suitable for neither high range games nor mid range games it can handle very much low range game with no issues. - My Opinion."
