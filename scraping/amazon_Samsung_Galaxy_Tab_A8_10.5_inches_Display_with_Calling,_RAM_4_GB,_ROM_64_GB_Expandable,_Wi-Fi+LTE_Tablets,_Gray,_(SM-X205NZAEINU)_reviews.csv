Padmam,Boomer Certified,"Over the years I have struggled to find a tablet series that I can confidentially recommend to boomers that want ""something to see their grand kids"" in XYZ foreign nation. Thankfully Samsung has stepped up their game, which is a good thing for my peace of mind. I bought this tablet many many months ago for my mother, because her main use case include reading scripts from ancient apocrypha and watching the most obscure YouTube videos known to mankind. Honestly I'd go insane if I wade through the junk that accumulates on boomer communication devices. That being said you're not here to listen to me vent, so let's get to the point.

[Display] - 4/5
It's a 10.5 inch TFT panel that carries the exceptional Samsung display quality. There is no sAMOLED functionality, and honestly I wouldn't expect it for this kind of price. The resolution is 1920x1200 which is more than enough for consuming content on a screen of this size, this includes YouTube videos, games and books. That being said this display is quite excessive for boomers who will only use the tablet for reading, you can do better buy buying a tablet half the price.

I saw a few students asking if this tablet supports the S-Pen on forums, I tested it out and no S-Pen is not supported. But I did find a few videos and posts that show people using those capacitive stylus to take notes in S-Pen and do some art. Also there is no Dex available for this tablet so keep that in mind for those that are using the tablet for studies.

[Connectivity] - 5/5
It has wifi and Bluetooth, literally all you need for home use. The connections are snappy and I haven't faced any issues setting it up, my mom haven't faced any issues either, despite her claiming that Bluetooth will cause cancer...

[Performance and Storage] - 4/5
I mean I am only giving 4/5 because it looks more critical. I don't use this device to properly stress test i, I did try playing some games on it and it seemed pretty snappy, I didn't download PUBG because my mother isn't a budding eSports pro based in Noida. It has an ""Octa Core Processor"" which is mot probably based on Unisoc architecture(arguably less reliable than Exynos and Qualcomm but that doesn't matter for light users like boomers). The most action this tablet sees is when my mother uses the Facebook app. I bought the 4GB RAM and 64 GB storage version because it is more than enough for my mother, I might add a 128GB SD card just in case she decides to install WhatsApp on it. 4GB RAM is more than enough for almost all modern applications and use cases, sure in 2023 8GB is the norm, but the tablet has not slowed down even a bot for my mother. I honestly wouldn't recommend you but this tablet for gaming if that is your primary use case.

[Camera] - 3.5/5
This is the crux of the usage for boomers, an absolute make or break situation, and honestly this tablet passes with flying colors. The front camera is positioned on the side allowing your eyes and face to be centered in a video call while the tablet is in landscape mode. This is a big win, and honestly places the tablet leagues ahead of the competition which will make you look schizophrenic during video calls as your eyes dash from side to side away from the camera. The front facing camera is 5MP and Samsung's software does a good enough job to make sure the image quality is good, I tested out a video call with my mother and the quality was very good in mediocre lighting. The rear camera is 8MP and does a very good job in scanning documents and for the average boomer, provides a good enough picture quality for those emergency neighborhood landfill photos.

I would say this is also more than enough for students who require a table to attend their online classes, because the teach ain't going to care if you look like handsome squidward. All in all the cameras perform their function to the t.

[Software] - 5/5
As far as Android tablets go in terms of software, this is the best you're gonna get. The One UI is the best out there for both power users and for boomers, and it is the thing carrying these tablets forward even with the mediocre hardware. You can multitask easily, install all sort of apps, customize the appearance of the tablet as well as program unique gestures to make life easier for the boomers who'll be using this device. If the boomer you're buying this tablet for was using another android tablet or an iPad, then transitioning to this will be no problem at all. The UI is tailor made to be as user friendly as possible. I kid you not, my mother who barely knows how to use her phone from OnePlus, uses thus tablet effortlessly. Also in my humble opinion the software is well suited for students as well, with a full version of Samsung notes available with the tablet, and many other features like the device profiles that can be set up for focus, entertainment etc. This is a testament to Samsung's software engineers, UI, and UX designers. The software alone should be enough to warrant a purchase.

Depending on when you buy the tablet you will have One UI 5.1 and Android 13 as the latest versions of the software. Anything beyond that is questionable(there will be regular security updates till 2024).

[Battery] - 5/5
It packs a 7000mAh battery that can comfortably the day on a full charge. No problem on that end.

[Conclusion] - 4.5/5
For the boomer/middle schooler in your life, this is a perfect tablet. It'll perform the functions of everything they need while making sure that anything extra will be uncomfortable enough to not pursue. Wallet friendly and very well built. I would say go for it, but with 2023 ending I'm pretty sure they'll be an upgraded option for this tablet in 2024, considering this tablet's support cycle has ended. Though if software us not a problem then you really can't go wrong with this tablet."
shaikh sfa,TA Trustworthy Companion for Everyday Use,"I've been using the Samsung Tab A8 for the past few months, and I must say, Samsung has yet again proven itself as a trustworthy brand. This tablet, while not a powerhouse, impressively handles basic functions such as entertainment, light gaming, and file management.

Pros:
1. **Best UI Experience:** Samsung's One UI provides a smooth and user-friendly interface, making the tablet a joy to navigate.

2. **3 Years of Software Update Confirmation:** Samsung's commitment to providing software updates for three years ensures your device remains secure and up-to-date.

3. **Good File Management System and Knox Security:** The tablet excels in file management, and Samsung's Knox security adds an extra layer of protection.

4. **Big Display with Good Build Quality:** The tablet boasts a generous display and solid build quality, enhancing the overall user experience.

5. **Quad Speakers with Very Loud Sound:** The audio experience is excellent with four speakers that deliver loud and clear sound, perfect for entertainment and multimedia.

Cons:
1. *TFT Display Feels Washed Out:* While the display is sizable, the use of a TFT panel results in colors that may feel less vibrant compared to other display technologies.

2. *Slow Charging with Included Charger:* The tablet's bundled 7.5V charger, despite supporting 15V fast charging, extends the charging time to 3-4 hours, which can be a bit of a drawback.

3. *Heavier Than expected:* The tablet is on the heavier side, which may not be ideal for extended one-handed use or portability.

In conclusion, the Samsung Tab A8 is a reliable choice for those seeking a tablet for everyday tasks. It might not be a top-tier performer, but its well-rounded features, secure software support, and quality user interface make it a commendable option for users who prioritize trustworthiness and functionality over cutting-edge specifications."
,Great,"After lot of comparison, settled for this. Happy. Works greats, seamlessly in playing small games, great camera. But display color may be a little toned down but it's good for the eyes, since i got it for kid's school studies and long hours learning watching youtube. Good audio and battery life. Call voice quality is brilliant, so clear. 10.5 is correct size as it is measured diagonally. Don't go for smaller ones. Lenovo P11 seems equally good or even better overall esp display, but settled for Samsung's reliability and service network. Happy."
ashok,Worth the money,"What i like about A8
-> Its slim
-> Metallic finish
-> Looks premium
-> Its fast enough for me, able to play most of the games and look into my notes.
-> Popup feature and shortcuts are good.
-> Battery life , will last more than a day if under normal usage (Excluding Gaming and watching high resolution videos)
-> Sound quality is awesome
-> Netflix can render HD Quality videos
-> 64 Gb is enough for me , as im not into gaming on Tab
-> great for studies.
-> close to stock android (Compared with google Pixel), did not see any bloat wear other than those apps of Samsung.

Things which could have been better
-> Fast charging (takes more than an hour to fully charge -- close to 2 hours)
-> No Sim feature , hence no calling feature
-> its heavy
-> Bezels could have been more thinner
-> Screen quality is good , but not great when compared to smart phones. But in par with other Tabs in the price segment .
-> Camera quality is OK OK , in par with other tabs in the price segment.

No regrets after buying the Tab, Its fast enough and gets the job done. Happy with what Samsung has provided."
Rahul R,Most overall satisfactory product in its category.,"Reviewing this after 24 hrs on using the product. After going thru various options in same category, found this to be the most affordable and complete overall package. Got the Wi-Fi 4gb+64gb variant. First of all the display resolution capped at 1080p is satisfactory does the job, for videos on streaming apps and youtube, display may be a letdown. Regards to software, on 15th Jan'23, recieved Android 13 update, works smoothly. Multi tasking is good and works flawlessly. Dont compare it with Samsung Smartphones as basic features like haptic feedback are missing from UI. As far as build and fit and finish its is very good, back panel is of metal and has matt finish, not too thick but sleek enuf. The screen size of 10+ inches is not easy to handle with one hand but feels comfortable with 2 hands and is quite manageable in landscape mode. The UI overall is very smooth and is well optimised for tablets unlike other brands. Cameras both front and back are above average. All around bezels are well uniform, front camera is in landscape mode. Made a good choice as many tablets in this category either have good display, or latest Android version or smooth UI. But this Samsung A8 fits the bill and checks all the right boxes. Go for it as it is a Samsung after all. Overall satisfied. Thank you Amazon and Samsung."
,Beautiful experience,"Pros:
1. Screen size of 10”+ at this price point is a very Good point!
2. Performance is good!
3. The speakers are amazing!
4. Knox Security included
5. Enough detailing to the tab and it feels so premium in hand!
Cons:
1. Samsung could have got an AMOLED into this price…
2. S-pen support or stylus support lacks in this device!
3. Supports fast charging but gets a 8W charger out of the box, takes a healthy time to fill the juice!
One extra note : Kuddos to team samsung for the screen, I have used A7 and now A8 initially without any cover not a single bit of scratch I noticed in the screen! Build is top notch"
Shashii Das,Good,Value for Money
Kallol Kashyap,Great buy!,"Bought this at 15k after seeing 4 star rating with about 4k reviews. Started reading reviews outside amazon after buying it & started getting second thoughts.
My usage is non-gaming, for email & browsing. Have previously owned tablets from Samsung & xiaomi. This tablet is amazing and offers beautiful integration with my Samsung mobile. I can make & take calls on the tablet since it is connected to my phone. Thought that the display may not be great but it is beautiful.
Other options considered including but not limited to Xiaomi, OPPO and Nokia.
Overall a great purchase, definitely recommend it!"
,Very good product,"Purchased this product for my kids about a year ago. It has been dropped and tossed by my kids and taken to service centre for minor repairs couple of times. But it is still running. So I say, this product is very durable and good product."

Hrishi Rao,A good buy under 20K...,"Bought Samsung A8 Tab 10.5 Inch LTE 4/64GB under 20K. First of all I am a loyal Samsung user. Using 02 phones and both are Samsung.

Pros:
1. Best in class under budget.
2. Screen quality is its USP.
3. Sound quality is of top notch.
4. UI is really good and easy to use.
5. No problem in using social media and OTTs.
Cons:
1. Touch is little laggy.
2. Not suitable for heavy gaming.
3. Battery is a disappointment.
4. Camera is a let down.
Overall I rate the product as 3.5 out 5. But for simple daily usage, it's a must but. Compared to other products available in market, this is the best option available..."
Bhupendra,Okey,Nothing extra
Mohammed Kamal Khan,Good,Good
Nikhil,Very sloooow to boot,"Not happy with the boot time, nor its general speed.
Everytime I boot it, it starts ""optimizing apps..."" even without app or OS updates, which takes additional time to complete.
Not happy overall, but using it only because of the money already spent buying it."
VIJIN KAMBLE,Display colour is ok ok,Speakers are good ...little bit heavy to use for long time ... display is sharp but not so colourful...side viewing is not upto the mark for the price of 15500
LMK,It does the work.,Bought it for my kid to watch videos and play kids ganes. Perfect. Inly space is too less
BIKASH PAUL,Seems to be a fine product.,Seems to be a nice product. Will be more clear after 3-4 months of use.
Kaustav,Poor battery life & awfuly slow charging speed.,"Poor battery life & awfuly slow charging speed.
Rest is Ok, however currently there are probably better tablets available in this price range."
Placeholder,Worth it!,"I am giving this review after using the tablet for 2 months. If you are searching for a economical friendly along with awesome working quality I think it's best to go with this tablet. Wifi can easily gets connected apps are really convenient to download. Till now I have downloaded many app but I didn't got any problem with it's performance i.e it's not hanging.
Overall good investment for students who solely want to do studies."
,Low end tablet,"I wanted an inexpensive product to read pdf files. This does the job but is slow, the screen isn't great. Spend 3 or 4k more and buy a better product. No fingerprint either. Inexpensive.. And we know why now."
Asha m.,Good,Good
HItesh,Best buy for children,"Touch is good although no android 14, Good for Entertainment value, Best Appearance"
akhilesh kumar,Slow processor and charging,Overall good product but charging is very slow. Samsung should work on this.
harish,Good buy,Nice tab 👌
Mahesh,Versatile tablet for everyone,"This tables id designed considering everyone in mind, excellent for online classes, videos and the sound quality is extremely good.

Screen size is pretty decent where you can easily focus the content without and distractions.

Processor : Performance if good so far, yet to load so.e heavy apps. Hope it not get struck and disappoint :)

Battery life : Its been more than a week since it's been unboxed, its holds its life for more than 20 Hrs when out in rugged use (of course with WIFI connected), and it runs for hours when it plugged for online video sessions. In nutshell Its SOLID PERFORMANCE.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND for this price tab."
Satendra Dixit,Good product,Good product but camera photos are not upto the mark
Shyam Mhaskar,Performance,Surprisingly A7 was better 😞
Srikanth,Worth for money,A decent configuration tab with a decent price. Timely delivery.
Davydovich Sergei,Nice tab. Average processor. Best for reading and watching video.,"The screen is bright enough - 400 nits.
Very loud speakers.
You can find on the photo how is text are looking.
If you need only for reading books and watching video - i not see a reasons to pay more for another models, only if you have not needed extra money.
4k video playing very nice.
Nice software. All Google services like Classroom working very nice without errors as on Xiaomi

CONS
- A little heavy. I had an iPad 6th gen and was lighter in weight.
- the processor would like to be faster. It's not slow, but I would like it to work faster.

I wanted to buy Xiaomi mipad 5 or Samsung S6 lite.
But as a result, I bought this tablet, because I don't see the point of paying more money if the tablet is needed only for reading books and YouTube."
,Camera is 👎🏼,It’s fine but both cameras are not even average.
Placeholder,Samsung A8 4 Gb 64GB tab.,"As the tab is from Samsung stable, it ca be relied upon though it is made in China. Display is good, battery quality is satisfactory. Touch screen operation appears to be very good just like feather touch. It did not hang yet since purchase a few days ago. But, to be frank, what it lags is its camera quality. Though the daylight picture gives more or less satisfaction but not all ones specifically its front camera pics. Had the camera quality been a bit upgraded, it would have been a good tab in the mid range. As to its looks, the tab is sleek & stylish. Delivery was as per schedule as committed by Amazon. The seller Apario is also trustworthy. Overall, the deal makes me happy if not happier. All the best!"
,5 w charger received in box it's very bad.,"Esse acha agr charger dete hi nhi or todi price km kr dete to vhi acha tha ..5 w se 2-3 ghante lg jate hai charge krne me hai
Jha Aaj kl phone 30 mint me. charge ho jate vhi ye unse 6 x jyada time le rha hai.very bad baki tab sandar hai.
Mene ye 18000 me liye hai and display ek dm jhkas hai eski mja aa jayega. Bs charger alg se Lena pdega"
Kuldeep Choudhary,Good tablet looks great with games and video,screen resolution and graphic quality in games looks great
Johnny James,Best,Nice product
Desi chhora,Amazing,Good product
Dudekula Khasim,Not great but good,"Works smoothly. Cameras are crappy, just 5/8 MP without flash so horrible picture quality. Actual storage is much lesser not 64 GB as claimed. Charger stopped working after 3 days. Video quality looks dull even at 1080p. Great for reading purposes and casual web surfing"
RM,No thanks,No thanks
Tarekh Kureshi,Versatile,Overall a good buy
Soumen Kumar Mundul,Perfect for the price range. NO Second Thoughts....,"Okay, this was a risky purchase since it used a Tiger T618 SOC. So, i was a little hesitant for its performance.

So here is a long-term use review (2 months)

Major Streaming
-------------------
Netflix - Works with Full HD
Prime Video - Works With Full HD
HotStar - Works with Full HD

The Basics
------------
Display Colors - Amazing for the price range. Samsung doesn't disappoint you.
SD Card: 512 GB Work Flawless
Charging: It Does Support Fast Charging, BUT it doesn't give you fast charger in the box. so, you will need to buy a fast charger yourself. Else it will take forever to charge it.
WiFi: WIFI5 - 433 Mbps.
Screen: TFT, not Amoled.
Sound: Very Loud and Crispy
Audio Out: 3.5 mm Jack
Speakers: 4 ( 2 Left + 2 Right)
Camera: Decent enough to take a picture of a document. Don't expect miracles from it.
At the time of this review. It Didn't get Android 13 Upgrade. However, its scheduled for it."
