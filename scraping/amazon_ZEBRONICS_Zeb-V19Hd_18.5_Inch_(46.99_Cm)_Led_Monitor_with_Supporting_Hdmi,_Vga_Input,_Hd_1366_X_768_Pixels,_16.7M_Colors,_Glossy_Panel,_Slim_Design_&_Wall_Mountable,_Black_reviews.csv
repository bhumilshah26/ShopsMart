Abhishek J.,Dont use for long hours. Buy if don't want to spend more.,"Note the difference in images of both monitors at their minimum brightness (and contrast in middle) with black image duplicated on both.

I bought This monitor (Zebronics Zeb-V16HD) to accompany my 24 inch Viewsoic 24(XG2405) Inch monitor as an additional multidisplay monitor. Zeb-V16HD LED backlight remain almost the same brightness at minimum brightness as it is at Max Brightness. The result is that the blacks are geryish and whites are piercing. I like to keep brightness low to avoid eye strain and when my eyes wander from Viewsonic to Zeb-V16HD they are strained by the blinding light of Zeb-V16HD compared to Viewsonic. While I understand that two monitors will always have different response to brightness, please see the images of both monitors at their minimum brightness with black image duplicated on both. The difference is glaring.

So I agree with what many other reviewers are saying, buy it if you want to use it for CCTV etc. But for a daily driver avoid it because what you save on this monitor will be deducted from your life as eye strain (and bad image quality because of terrible blacks) every day of your life. For better quality buy from a brand that actually makes monitors has control over their manufacturing and quality rather than a brand that just orders from a manufacturer. But of course, they will be much more expensive. However, considering the price of this monitor I consider this a good deal if you don't want to spend more.

A couple of points to note.

The Piece I received resolution of 1440 x 900 , a step above 1280 x 800. So that is a pleasant upgrade. But that may not be true for ever batch.

Another good thing is that the monitor has setting to adjust each color individually (Red Green Blue) in addition to Brightness and Contrast. So that enabled me to set display on warm side to reduce perceived eye strain.

My TataPlay HD set top box was set at 50Hz output. The monitor did not detect it. But once I changed the set top box settings to 60Hz, the monitor detected it and worked properly."
,N0. 1 WASTE MONITOR,"Pros:
1. Nice size for narrow work area. Not too much rectangle.
2. True 22 inch.

Cons:
1. The monitor is full of glare just like mirror. I bought it for work from home and on every webpage you see your image.
2. Buttons to adjust brightness or contrast located back side and super inconvenient to adjust. They would have given Joystick ðŸ•¹ like Acer is giving in its monitors.
3. First order was defective (dead pixel in screen).
4. Second order is also defective (developed screen flickering issue in just few days).

Tip: Guys, don't buy electronics from Amazon.in they will send defective item and never help you with return. Worst customer service always disconnect the calls or tranfer over and over. Very inconvenient to tell same story to another agents. Amazon will start sinking right from now. Waste customer support."
Athar,It is worth of cost,Working good mirroring with HDMI cable and light waight
,Zebronics 18-Inch Monitor ( good buy but could be better),"The Zebronics 18-inch monitor caught my attention due to its compact size and promising features.

Display Quality:

The display offers a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels, providing clear visuals for its size. Colors appear vibrant, and the glossy panel enhances the overall viewing experience. The 18-inch size is ideal for those seeking a more compact display.

Connectivity:

With support for HDMI and VGA inputs, the monitor offers versatility in connecting to various devices. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for users with multiple devices seeking seamless integration.

Performance:

In everyday use, the monitor performs well for regular tasks like browsing, document editing, and multimedia consumption. However, users engaging in graphics-intensive activities may find its limitations.

Durability:

While the build quality is generally decent, it's essential to handle the monitor with care, as the slim design may be less forgiving to rough handling. Consider the intended usage environment to ensure longevity."
Great game,Value for money,Like to buy if I need again.
Ankur Singh,Very good,"Nice product. Value for money. Picture quality is so good.
Initially received a defective piece, but Amazon helped me to replace the product . Thank you Amazon."
,EXTREMLY BAD PRODUCT // BLACK LIST IT,VERY VERY VERY BAD PRODUCT. DID NOT WORK FOR 2 HOURS // IN PLACE OF REPLACING WE HAVE BEEN MADE TO RUN AND AKED TO WAIT FOR 5 DAYS. DOES AMZON WANTS US TO CLOSE OUR BUSINESS FOR 5 DAYS.
Tech Advice,Good Quality at this price Range,"I am using this screen from last 2 year, no issue till.
Good screen size not too small bit not too big as well.
60Ghz is enough for play 2k video"
Amazon Customer,"Worth overall, but very brighter.","The monitor is performing well since a week after delivery, no hardware issues were found, but the monitor is very bright and causes strain to eyes if continuously used. This is probably a flaw in controller firmware and brightness cannot be reduced via any operating system. Reducing brightness from built-in OSD menu (Buttons provided on monitor) does not help either.

If anyone faces this issue, one solution is to try out different combinations of brightness and contrast in the OSD menu. You can also try reducing the RGB color values. Most graphics drivers have brightness and color options. Overall, this monitor is not bad in the given price range."
Anurag. H,Decent monitor at a reasonable price,"Play Video
Let me get straight to Point.

Things to consider:
>This Monitor does not come with HDMI cable.
>Only VGA cable and Power Cable was provided.
> There is no USB port at back.
> Chromecast can be connected to HDMI port and it might work with Laptop or Mobile for screensharing.
If your Chrome cast needs Power, there is no USB port in Monitor, you might have to give power supply through Power bank or Mobile Adapter, Etc.
> For me Screen Sharing on Mobile worked fine but on Laptop i think Chromecast faced challenge.
> If you are using it as additional Monitor, It is advisable to connect using HDMI cable for clarity. As with Chromecast i could get only 30Hertz Refresh Rate and Image Quality from Mobile or Laptop was not great. Maybe if you have 4K Chromecast or Firestick it might work more efficiently.

Display Tech:
> Resolution: 1280 x 800
>Refresh Rate: I could get is max70 Hertz using HDMI and only 30 Hertz on Chromecast device, might be fine for all other work excluding Graphic Intensive task like Gaming or Video Editing where higher refresh rate is desired.

Overall:
Zebronics as a brand has created a decent product at a good price point.
If you need a monitor for some regular office work this would just work fine.
YouTube video works fine with good clarity.
I was Looking at other options, but my office had provided this and i thought screen size would not suffice but when i got it I think it just works fine as the screen size is slightly bigger than Laptop screen size so no issue of refocusing and hence no strain on eyes."
,Happy for the product ðŸŽ‰,Love it
The filter is not working good ...i have a leakage problem...the taste of water is also not look like pure ...so disappointed,Good,Product not having USB type interface
Jaisan,Nice product,Good clarity
Rajaguruvel,Decent,"Bought this as a monitor for the CCTV cameras. It's a decent product.
Picture quality is good. But can be viewed only from straight. You won't see the images from side angles. It's a basic monitor only."

John Prakash,ZEBRONICS LEF monitor,It's a good product & we use it for CCTV monitor. Really this product is worth buying at this price.

Aman Patil,Except Power Cable everything is awesome,"Except Power Cable everything is awesome, just after two days power cable got a bit uncovered. Also monitor is not sturdy , monitor shakes unnecessarily , even a ceiling fan air flow shakes the monitor. Expected a bit more sturdy . Bezel and monitor screen are simply super. Blue light control and speaker sound , clarity are added features."
,Best in budget,Nice
K MADHU SUDHAN RAO,Zebronics is super ðŸ™‚,Amazon packing is not very good today for this item . But okay. Zebronics lcd monitor is so super . Hurry up all. Very biggest screen
Rayies Amin,A very good product from a good brand,"I'm using it as a monitor for my 4 channel cctv setup and it is doing good.
The screen is good and I have no complaints for now.
A good product."
Nivedita Unawane,Average not soo bad nd not so good,"Looking wise the product is very good but the only thing is uh have to see the screen in straight way on another angles the image looks negative (black n white no clr)
It is good for official nd some normal use not for gaming,movies,etc"
Anirban Halder,Low price best monitor,
Raju,Worth for money but . ..,"Moniter is delivered with good packing. Image quality is good. The only disadvantage is, we need to look the monitor in a straight way. Else picture looks like negative image on certain angle"
Keith F.,Good value for money,"Very good value for money product. It's small enough to carry in small suitcase. Can be kept in small home desks. Worth 5 stars.

Deducting 1 star because the initial product shipped to me was defective. Image was blurry then it died within 5 days.

But Amazon replaced it easily. The replaced one works like a charm. I didn't realise its actual intended image quality untill i got the replaced product."
anand,Blurry display,"Monitor have blurry display. Tried to troubleshoot by own with different solutions, but problem not resolved"
Shopper Japs,"Price wise best, but not as a main PC screen",Oozing so much light even after all kinda setting. The setting buttons and functioning is unfriendly user case wise. Couldnt use as main PC screen due to disconfirt in eyes due to glaring whiteness. Made in India prpduct and at best price that's plus point. Power cable is short. Can use Firestick and make it TV easily as it has a speaker and audio jack.
Rahul A R,Very basic monitor to be used for basic purpose,This is a cheap monitor which you can use for viewing security footage or for your kids for studying if you don't have good budget. Rating 5 because it works as expected and has a HDMI port.
prasanna lakshmi,Not recommended for commercial,No clear image clarity. It was appear very black.
Mohammed ansary,Value for the product,I bought the monitor last month it's work perfectly.
A.C.,Great monitor for the price,"Edit: I have reduced 1 star to 4 stars because just now I spotted a dead red pixel. It was looking like a spec of dust but now can noticed it is a dead pixel and using monitor testing site found out it was a dead red pixel as it appears as black only when the monitor is kept fully red in color.

1 VGA 1 HDMI 1 Audio In port
Sound is very decent and flat (Ensure you setup 100% volume using the monitor controls)
Bass in sound is lacking but seriously I don't mind - this is a monitor not TV
Both VGA and HDMI Give excellent pic quality
Works very well at 75Hz
Viewing angles are adequate for work station

First, I was able to get it set up in 5 minutes with my mac. It has both VGA and HDMI ports. 1 each. Both are equivalent picture quality. Now the monitor info says it is 60Hz and cannot be used for TV. But I am running it at 75Hz on my mac. Both on VGA and HDMI 75hz works well at full resolution. In VGA it can be very slightly soft image if you care to notice. I connected my settopbox to it and straight away was watching TV. So just get it and it won't disappoint at all. The price makes it worth."
DEVARAJU K G,Nice product,Good tk use at college lab

Amazon Customer #Kerala,Good product,Sound clarity is good. Value for money. Packing to be improve..
SAMINUL,Very bad product and it's service centre also,"i had purchased this monitor on 5th August,2023 and had used as a monitor for my CCTV. but after using this monitor for few days..some lines appeared accross the dislay and subseqently got two black spot on the display... today i had visited the Zebronic Service centre at Guwahati but they had refused to accept my claim. Although there is not a single sign of physical damage but they had rejected saying that there is an internal damage...such a hopeless experience...."
,Worth the Pricing!!!,"Being a Trustworthy Brand in Electronics, they did not disappoint me..
Good product for a good price, It supports HDMI too...
Just 1 day of use...impressed...

Of course, there are certain areas of improvement - shaky stand, adjustment buttons are at the back, and a glossy screen (I am able to see my own image when the screen background is black)

Overall a good product"
REJITHA HARISH,Nice product,I am using this monitor from last 1 year 4 months and it is working. I you want to purchase a low budget monitor then it's a great option. Company should add one or two option for brightness because if want minimum brightness of screen there is not any option to do that.
Rajat soni,Good but speaker is worst,Resolution is good but audio breaks
