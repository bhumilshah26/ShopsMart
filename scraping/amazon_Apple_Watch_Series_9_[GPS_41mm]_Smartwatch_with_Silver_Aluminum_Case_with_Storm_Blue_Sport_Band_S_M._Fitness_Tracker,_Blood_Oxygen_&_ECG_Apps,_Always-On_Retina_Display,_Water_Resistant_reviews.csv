Amazon Customer,Nice watch,Suits the purpose and looks great!
Shobhit Gupta,First Apple Watch! What an AMAZING Experience! ü´∂,"The Apple Watch Series 9 in Midnight Black is an absolute show-stopper! Its display is a visual masterpiece, boasting impeccable clarity, vibrant brightness, and a remarkably smooth interface. Performance-wise, it's a speed demon, and the haptic feedback adds a thrilling dimension to using it.

The speakers deliver crystal-clear sound at an impressive volume, making calls and music playback a joy. And with the anticipation of the Double Tap feature arriving soon, the excitement just keeps building.

I've had the pleasure of testing its health features, including ECG, SpO2, heart rate monitoring, fitness tracking, and Emergency SOS, and they've all performed flawlessly. The battery life holds up admirably for daily use.

As my first Apple Watch, it's exceeded my wildest expectations, and I can't wait to unlock all the incredible possibilities it offers."
,Good product,The ECG is too close accurate
Sultan,Best in the segment.,"Watch built quality, functionality top notch.
I was waiting for long time since I felt 42k was bit much for smart watch , happy to get it for 33k."
Amar simha,Super,Awesome product
Ganesh,Battery Issue,"Battery is very frequently low!!
Only 4 to 5 hours backup"
Rajat verma,always apple,best product and accurate one
Kishore,Awesome !,Worth it's cost !
Vijay Samuel,Fake watch,No refund no replacement
sumant bharadwaj,Apple Watch series 9. Great watch !,"Replaced my first gen watch SE with this series 9. Love the Always On Retina display and health sensors and have the same full day battery. Even the fast charging type C braided cable looks premium and durable now. Sport loop is soft and light, in my opinion feels better than the silicon one and is more comfortable to wear while sleeping since I want to track my sleeping routine. On device Siri also seems to be working a tad bit faster and accurate.
Battery life is the only area where this particular watch can do better, maybe a 2 day battery will be just perfect."
Anishka,My first apple watch /value for Money /one time investment,"This is the first time after much speculations and weighing all the other options I decided to buy an Apple Watch.
I‚Äôve been using it for last two months and it‚Äôs flawless.
It has every feature, and of course, using it with iPhone or iPad Makes it very easy to use .
The best part about the watch is it‚Äôs connectivity, gestures, of course.
It‚Äôs battery life is very good. I have to charge once in one and a half day and that‚Äôs all ,it last for long, given that it is connected with Wi-Fi whole time.
It charges very quickly.
When it comes to appearance, I ordered 41 MM, it comes with sports strap band which is really good quality, only if somebody wants a different strap then you can purchase separately otherwise, no need at all.
Separately, I ordered a protector and a screen guard.

If somebody is looking for new Apple Watch who has never used it, this money is worth, but I‚Äôve heard that people already have previous series watches then there is no point in upgrading. I‚Äôve heard that it is pretty much same but for new investment this is Best latest. 10 on 10."
,Super,Super
DR.SUDHAKAR,it has good bpm and ecg monitorisation it every help full for my heath,worth for person how have heart problems
subbiahpandian,Best,Best in the business ‚ô•Ô∏è
Dixant chauhan,Damaged product,Damaged product plz change my product
Rajiv,Does what it does best for fitness!,Display is really crisp and performance is outstanding. Apple Watch does it best for fitness. Though the finger gestures are not so on point but I think they‚Äôll improvise it in the future. Finger gestures work well with active notifications or default Apple Watch Apps.
Sagar Atalatti,Nice and awesome features mostly double pinch is awesome üëçüèª,"Must buyüëçüèªüëçüèª Double pinch feature is awesome ‚åö but it‚Äôs very delicate to use I am using daily and it‚Äôs after just one month on body gets small scratches
Feature of watch are amazing but it‚Äôs get scratches easily
Hande with care"

The apple watch looks stunning and the sports loop band has a very nice fit to it. One of the best apple watches and best smartwatch in the world."
ISHAN K.,First Apple watch | Good Experience,"With Double Tap and a faster Siri, the Apple Watch Series 9 is slightly easier to use."
,"Best product üëç I bought with SBI EMI Rs:- 51,000",

Priyank,Excellent,The best watch I ever had
Ram,I am very happy with the product,
,Poor customer support,"We have ordered apple series 9 watch of 45mm, after receiving the product the dial is bigger than my wrist so I wanted to replace it with 41mm. After 40 minutes of conversation with Amazon customer support they suggested me to use the product as it is as they can‚Äôt even replace the product. It‚Äôs not looking good as it doesn‚Äôt fit and not looking good at all. Even after spending so much money I can‚Äôt even use the product anymore. This is ridiculous they don‚Äôt respect people‚Äôs hard earned money. I am very disappointed with Amazon‚Äôs service and support. I am going to close all of my accounts with amazon soon."
Ritick Chowdhury,"Battery draining very fast, its gps + cellular version but not connecting to my simcard plan.",Product is not good
Akhil,It got delivered without the band!!,"It such a inconvenience, I starting to believe i should not order expensive stuff through amazon anymore. The order got delivered but when I checked the sport loop was missing. I had so many stuff planned for the next it is just disappointing. Now I have requested for refund or replacement lets see, I will keep you updated."
SK,Defective product sold,"Do not buy from Amazon, there is no replacement for defective product sold. You need to visit Apple stores to fix the issue. Waste of money buying from here. Unfortunately cannot rate below 1 star."
Kunal Ranchoddas,It‚Äôs the gold standard they say,A great buy at a great deal on amazon. Got it cheaper than other retail websites. Do check the description as they have mentioned gps plus cellular in style but its just GPS
,Awesome,
kanuri hanish,"Great watch, fits perfectly.","Got the gps+ cellular version, feels really good in hand and this will really motivate you to exercise everyday. There are several amazing features, really enjoying this watch."
,Damaged product selling. Stuck the screen and doesn‚Äôt any work. Don‚Äôt buy any product.,Screen stuck and doesn‚Äôt any work. Damaged product selling. Don‚Äôt buy any product.
Barshan Roy Chowdhury,Problem in update of step& distance count,"When walking Step count is not updated instantly on watch face in step & distance complications, It need to correcting in next software update"
,Think twice before you buy,"Pros - Fast charging & Good battery life 2 days, Comfortable while wearing, Safety & ECG features.
Cons - Calorie tracking is not accurate, Cannot play music on Watch, Cannot browse net on watch, limited apps - difficult to believe but it‚Äôs truth"
KUMAR LUCKY,Fake product. please don't buy it,"When I received the product , this is in apple box but when I open it it seems like some different item .USB cable is not going with the watch .it's different as required. Strap what ever I have ordered came as different one . Not able to open the watch . Totally fake product . Also there is no return policy.my money just got wasted."
Vijay Chaudhari,Awesome Watch!,"Watch looks Awesome in sport loop, i will suggest breathable sport loop instead of rubber strap, I ordered the Starlight Color and this was my perfect decision!! Another thing is I added gift wrap option for less damage in shipment, I thought they will handle this package with care, but they did'nt. Main box was damaged little bit from left bottom side."
Placeholder,Apple had made a good product,"I have purchased a new iWatch every year and iPhone also I wish in future they make good gadgets and products
üëçüëç"
Suhani,Worst.....step count is not at all accurate...,Worst watch ever....I have wested my hard earned money by trusting this brand but worst customer service.after 8 months of purchase I hardly wear the watch 2 to 3 times just as a ornament....so again worst exp...while making roti it automatically increases 3000 to 4000 steps...thats why I have paid my hard earned money?
Niccccks,Beware of Apple Watches,"This is what happens, especially after warranty period. The Apple folks are not able to even fix it. They are ready to replace but seeking full price."
,osm,"my first apple product and it is worth the money..give a feeling of premium
very very oustanding watch worth the money"
Mohd Momin,Received a fake watch.,Watch is not original one. Unable to charge using magnetic charger. Watch is not turning ON.
