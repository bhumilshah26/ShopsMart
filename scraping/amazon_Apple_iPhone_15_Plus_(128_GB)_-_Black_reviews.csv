Chaitannya Supe,Switched from android to iphone,"I have used redmi phones for almost 9 years including redmi note 4, note 7 pro, note 11 pro. I got bored to android and wanted some change so switched to iPhone. Redmi phones otherwise are awesome too.üòä

Following are my experiences based on 8 days usage:
- Battery backup is very good.
Scenario 1:
I got 3 days of backup with light usage(picking up the calls, replying whatsapp, 30 minutes of gameplay (genshin impact). For 1 and half days, my phone was on battery saver mode. For the rest of duration it was on normal mode.
Scenario 2: Only on normal mode with moderate usage it gives 2 days of backup with light usage.
- Performance is awesome. Everything is buttery smooth from apps to games.
- Latest ios 17 is good as well. I didnt felt much problems while switching from android to iphone. Many things are improved.
- You can remove most of the inbuilt apple apps with ios 17.

Things i love about iPhone over android (redmi phones):
- flawless performance especially for gaming. No android can offer this level of smoothness.
- excellent and all rounder camera.
- more battery backup compared to any android

Things i love about android over iPhone:
- android is more flexible than ios. e.g you can‚Äôt select all emails in gmail app in iphone. You cant close all background running apps in one shot like we do it in android.
- apps are way better in terms of usability.
- i personally found that ios has more bugs than android ( which can be felt by a common user). E.g. keyboard sound suddenly increases, not able to receive a call sometimes. Apple do resolve these in their updates but for a phone which costs this much it‚Äôs embarrassing.
- cheap cost compared to iphone. People usually go for iphone when they get bored from android (my case) or to be a status symbol or who needs reliable phone for long run. But the things have changed now. Even android offers long term support now and they are bit cheaper compared to iphone giving you more features and usability.

Final verdict: iphone is allrounder phone in my opinion. Great camera, great performance, great battery life, great cost tooüòÅ. So if you need a change definitely go for it. Its a great phone."
Fahad A.,Incredible Phone. Recommend buying this phone if budget is not a concern.,"The Apple iPhone 15 Plus is a little on the higher side of budget but it‚Äôs a great phone. The battery life is amazing, and offers over 15 hours of Screen On Time and over 36 hours of Standby Time and takes a little over an hour using the Apple 20W USB C Charger to completely charge.

The lack of 120Hz display for the price range doesn‚Äôt make sense but I barely notice the 60 Hz display even when I use it next to my Samsung Galaxy S20 with its 120Hz display.

There are a very few instances when the software doesn‚Äôt work as intended but nothing that‚Äôs majorly noticeable or work hampering.

The 256GB Storage along with eSIM is a great use case for me. The Camera is usually very good with brilliant video recording, however I personally don‚Äôt like how the iPhone processes faces through its HDR. It captures literally all the details of the face, even if one doesn‚Äôt want it to and sadly there is no way to turn off HDR in newer models. HDR Videos or Dolby Vision Videos however are very well captured.

The phone has a very good stereo setup that has noticeable bass. Consuming media on the phone is a delight.

The USB C is a valuable addition that helps me use the same USB C Earphones that I use with my Samsung. The phone along with my Apple Watch SE and Airpods Pro makes a great combination."
,Product is good but features are not working properly.,"My iPhone is delivered in good condition. I am using location service in WhatsApp regularly.
Apple Maps not working properly. I installed google maps but end up with difficulty to make it default maps, location service.
Apple may have to fix this issue. Or if I missed something then I will have to in coming days."
ponnuchamy,Just wow,"This phone working so well, UI is simple and ultra smooth, screen is bright and vibrant, if you are long time android user you can switch for iphone for a new experience, battery life is also so good, one thing I really miss is call recording,"
Aniruddh,"Very helpful, protective & secured having a long battery life , good looking phone",I like most this product.
,Iphone 15 plus,"Iphone 15 plus has an excellent camera..cinematic mode for shooting videos,it is slightly larger than Iphone 15 and the older Iphone 11 which I have. It is a good buy from the brand if you're looking for practicality. Some people complained about the heating issue, it isn't much and was there when charging initially but it's probably normal as it's not affecting the performance of the phone yet"
DR BABLU BHATTACHARJEE,Honest Review from a usual Android User,"I got this phone on 26th September after ordering the very first day of release. I must say the wait was worth it.
The last Iphone had was 11 (basic model) and I was happy with it. Since then I switched to OnePlus 9pro and Samsung Z Flip 3, and then finally this.
I knew it will be a good phone and delivered more than what I was expecting.
I decided to go for it mainly because of the camera as they finally gave 48mp and then almost everything which a 14pro was offering. It hits it out of the park as for last 2 months I have not experience any issues.
The best part is the battery life. I did see comparison vids and they all are true. I totally believe it has the best battery among all the models apple has offered.
The pro models would definitely offer more but I do not see a reason to spend that much wherein this is also costly but atleast makes it worth it..
Go for it without any second thoughts.. it offers performance, look and statement for sure...
5 on 5 from me as a user!!"
PDB,Apple means satisfaction,Thanks to Amazon for fast delivery
Samay Thapa,Best value for money,Its Osm
Ahmad,Wonderful design and love the matte finish,Although I would love a glossy side like the Pros but still it‚Äôs amazing.
Navaneen,Overhyped I would say,"Initially happy on starting that I finally owned iphone that too latest model. I know price to feature ratio is low, but still chose this as every one said there will be no lag in playing bgmi or pubg. But in reality, there are frame drops even on basic settings. Probably optimization issue but still, we paid hefty price.
New update:
Bought honor 90(12gb ram, 512gb memory) for my dad at 22k and it is faaar superior to this, be it camera, performance, screen, Ram management or storage. It's curved screen with higher level of brightness and smoothness kicks the iphone out. Only plus is iphones dual speakers. Don't purchase blindly. Mainly if you are some one coming from Android. You have to pay hefty for supported gadgets too. Think thrice before purchase."
,received as committed,"A product worth its price.
Quality delivery ensured by Amazon adhering to the committed timelines.
Thank you Amazon Team !"

,Value for money,Writing this review after 45 days. iPhone 15 plus is value for money phone. Working perfectly fine without any issues. Initially it had some hitting issue but it was resolved after iOS update.
Amazon Customer,"Canera quality is very poor , especially front camera","1. Phone is fast .. display is superb .
And phone is easy to use as well.
2. Camera is disappointing, in the same condition phone camera is giving different results may some software enhancement. If you try to zoom the picture would become too grinned.
3. While charging it is heating (OS updated)
4. Stand by is goofy, sometimes working sometimes not.

Update 07 Nov 23:
1. Phone is randomly heating and only getting cooled down when switch off the data.
2. Battery is superb lasting nearly 2 days.
3. The speakers totally amazied me. Sound quality is suoerb. I don't know how they managed it but I am so impressed."

Camera features are awesome
Customisable and perfect
Best phone so far obviously
Battery is perfect
Original phone
Checked everywhere was reluctant to buy from this seller

Hitesh,Awesome,I was just sifted from android to IOS and just learning but it is awesoms experiance
,Perfect for work and fun,I was initially a bit worried about the form factor because of the size but the device is the perfect size for both work and entertainment. Apple never disappoints you.
Subhamoy Goswami,the Battery Queen with the best pink shade!,"Got it at MRP but it‚Äôs fully worth it. Firstly, the screen size is really good for videos, etc. and the Battery!! It‚Äôs currently the best among all the iPhones till date so if you‚Äôre a heavy phone user you‚Äôll find this perfect! The new upgraded cameras along with the dynamic island makes it feel super premium, more like a Pro than a base iPhone. Amazing experience! And there isn‚Äôt any problems like heating issues and isn‚Äôt made of titanium so I won‚Äôt worry too much about shattering the back glass."
kurohh,Best non-pro iPhone,Everything is absolutely great about this phone.
,I am so happy,Great indian festival days I bought apple 15 awesome products and future and I am very thankful to Amazon
Arun,Just for Show off in Indian market,"Iphone in indian market is a closed box. Just for status quo, it offers nothing. I had to sell it off at loss and bought samsung. No customizations, no true caller, all it offers is security but at what cost ? ? After using it for 10 days i felt i have traversed back in time to year 2000 - you will have to pay for everything, even for a simple ringtone. If you have been android user from long time, i would suggest never switch to ios, you will hate it after all phone is our daily companion these days."
SHANKAR O,Top quality product.,Everything about the phone is good. No problem of overheating. Go for it.
Saurabh Pandey,Value for money,The build quality is too good as well as It's too lighter then previous models and easy to use
ABHISHEK MEHROTRA,Awesome,"iPhone 15 plus is slightly different from 14 . 15 have back camera of 48 Mp .
Battery life is good .
Sound quality is awesome."
Burman Nayak,FAST AND LONGLASTING BATTERY,A usual faster than previous versions. 48 MP camera redefines the pictures.
