Sameer Khan,Disappointing experience with recurring panel issues,"Certainly! Here's a refined ver

I purchased a Samsung TV at start of 2023(55 inch a big investment for middle class folks), and within just 2.5 weeks of installation, I encountered a screen failure. Despite contacting the company, I was informed that only the panel would be replaced, which took 2 to 3 weeks to complete. Unfortunately, after 8 to 9 months, the same issue resurfaced, rendering the TV unusable once again.

While the engineer assigned to the case was sympathetic, the company continually insisted on replacing the panel rather than providing a new TV. After weeks of back-and-forth, I reluctantly accepted the panel replacement, realizing the company had no intention of offering a more satisfactory resolution.

In total, within the first 10 months of ownership, my TV was non-functional for a significant portion of time, totaling around 40 days. This experience has left me deeply dissatisfied with Samsung's customer service and overall product quality. I hope this feedback serves as a cautionary tale for potential buyer's.

Needless to say feeling trapped with the issue I had to invest in extending my warranty for another 2 to 3 years, which is a smart thing to do.

The product is great but my experience has been horrific and in constant fear when next panel issue will pop up..."

Sahil Rathod,A Rollercoaster Ride with Samsung TVs,"I recently took the plunge into the world of smart TVs, starting with the Samsung i Smart Cue60 model from Amazon. At first, everything seemed peachy keen, but my excitement quickly plummeted when I discovered four pesky dead pixels just a few days into the TV affair. üôÑ
Kudos to Amazon's customer service, though‚Äîthey swooped in with efficiency after my distress call. Despite the pixel debacle, they swiftly processed my refund, leaving me both grateful and TV-less. üõçüëè
Undeterred, I decided to give it another shot and turned to Flipkart for a second act, choosing the Samsung Cue70 model with its promising Assistant feature. Well, fate had a different script for me this time. Lo and behold, I unwrapped a used TV with questionable packaging and a rather prominent dead pixel. üòì
Frustrated with the cycle of returns, I sought advice from a tech-savvy friend who nonchalantly informed me that dead pixels are the norm in LED TVs. Armed with a two-year warranty, I decided to keep the TV, throwing caution to the wind. I even opted for an extra year of coverage, playing the long game. üéÆ
Whether this gamble pays off or not is a cliffhanger in itself. As I embark on this uncertain TV journey, I feel compelled to warn potential buyers of the Cue60 and Cue70 models‚Äîbrace yourselves for the dead pixel roulette; chances are, you might find yourself spinning the wheel. üé∞
For the rest of us, let's not sweat the small stuff‚Äîthese are just materialistic things. Life has more important matters to offer. Here's to staying calm and embracing the uncertainties of the electronic world! Cheers to a pixel-perfect future or not. üòáüçª"

Leela,Value for money,One of the most profitable purchase considering the price and how long a tv lasts.
Subhasis patra,Be ready to pay more at the time of installation,"As one would like to replace HDMI, USB,
the wall mounting that comes with in the box is a fixed mounting, which is of hardly any use.

The installation guy will bring a flexibile mounting and charge you between 2000-2500‚Çπ for this change.
Charges at the time of reporting to Samsung are zero.
Samsung should consider providing flexible wall mounting to avoid extra expense of customer"

Swadesh,Amazing product.,"I recently purchased the Samsung crustal vision 4K Smart TV, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every aspect.

The only suggestion for samsung is to place the LAN port along with other ports. The current position makes it quite difficult to adjust with back wall."

Sumeet Kumar Mishra,Excellent Visual Experience with Room for Audio Improvement,"I recently purchased the Samsung 43-inch Smart TV and have been thoroughly impressed with its stunning visual display and smart features. The crisp images and vibrant colors make every viewing experience enjoyable.

While the overall performance deserves a solid 5 stars, I must note that the sound quality is average. Although it gets the job done, audiophiles may find it lacking in depth and clarity. I recommend investing in external speakers or a soundbar to enhance the audio experience.

In summary, if you prioritize a top-notch visual display and smart functionality, this Samsung TV is an excellent choice. Just be prepared to complement it with additional audio equipment for a more immersive sound experience."
