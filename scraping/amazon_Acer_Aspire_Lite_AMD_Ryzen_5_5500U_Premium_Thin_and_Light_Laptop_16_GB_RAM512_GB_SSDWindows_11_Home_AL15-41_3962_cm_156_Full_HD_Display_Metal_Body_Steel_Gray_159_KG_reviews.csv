Riya saini,Good,Nyc packing good quality
,Average product,"It's not bad, but not good either. I bought it for 38,990. I was getting the same price for some other acer laptop with intel i5 1155g7 processor and IPS display, but I missed the deal. So, I bought this ‚òπÔ∏è.

Pros:
1- Performance is not an issue. Decent performance for most of the tasks.
2- Didn't do gaming, so not sure of that. But for programming, it's good.
3- Good for multitasking.
4- Audio is good. It's not loud, but sufficient and it comes with Nahimic audio (for which you will have to download it's app) which enhances it's audio capabilities. Audio can be optimised for different purpose.
5- Sufficient ports. Also have type C port.
6- It has control center to control fan speed, external keyboard light, manage fan speed, power.
7- Battery is decent and can last 4-5 hours on regular workload. But on heavy workload, it will last around 2-2.5 hours.
8- Lookwise it is good.
9- lifetime windows 11 home.

Cons:
1- Although display is antiglare FHD. It's not IPS, so it looks crisp but average. It's just ok for the purpose of coding or regular tasks where we just want the work to be done. Since viewing angle are bad, so for entertainment, it's good for single person for watching movies but not for multiple people. Display is not good for graphic designer who needs color accuracy.
2- There is no backlit keyboard. So, if you want backlit, connect external keyboard with backlit.
3- Although it has an SSD, I didn't find the boot time to be faster. It is fast but didn't meet my expectations.
4- Graphic card is not dedicated which is just good for normal work. I don't think you will enjoy gaming on it. It can play light games but surely you won't enjoy gaming on such system. And it won't able to play high demanding games.
5- Doesn't have activated ms office. You will have to buy it's keys.

Note:
You can install a separate harddisk (HDD) for storing data. Screws are provided with laptop.

For me, the bottom side became very hot and fans started making noise, when it first arrived and I was installing windows updates on it first used it on my bed, that is without proper ventilation. But with proper air flow, it doesn't heat.

Conclusion:
If you are limited on budget and only want your work to be done and doesn't care much about display quality or back lit keyboard or you aren't a gamer, you can buy it.
And if you already bought it, don't regret your decision. It's a ok laptop for most of the task and will get your work done.

UPDATE:- It hangs in middle, and everything stops working not even power button unless I press it for long time to force shutdown.....all my work was lost and mind you I was not doing a heavy task that it couldn't handle, simple web browsing and it stopped in middle, nothing worked....really frustrated..... Don't know if it was windows 11 issue or due to cheap hardware of this machine,ü•πüò°"
Pankaj,"Works great with Windows, ok with Linux","I purchased this mainly because of the support for an in-built SATA port. This was the only one available with SATA port and reasonably recent CPU and a reasonable price. On that front, it is great.

However, I wanted to use it with Linux, and on that front I took a huge risk. Luckily, almost everything works fine on Linux. However, suspend to RAM doesn't work. To go into details, the BIOS doesn't support S3 sleep. It only supports S0x sleep, support for which is only beginning to mature in Linux. I am currently forced to use hibernate, which is slower."

HRJ,Everything Good except Display,"i am student so my main objective is to attend online classes which works great for me, it's very fast and snappy for day to day work.

Main issue is just display, its TN panel so don't expect too much from it, in fact its very Poor quality but for IPS display you have to spend extra 10k so considering the prize it's the best laptop you can get under 35k.

if you have a tight budget or don't want to spend too much parents' money then go for it.

Also its screen wobbles little bit under fan."
Rahul Avasthi,Great,"Bought this laptop during the republic sale of 2024 and I also upgraded the ram from 16gb to 32gb 2400mhz , and a sata 500gb SSD , Since I won't be using this for gaming and only work it's a good value for money laptop go for it if you want to use it for work purposes 5/5."
,Very nice Laptop,Very nice looking and very good performance laptop and good looking...but I m received my laptop so no Few Charge so I m Sad for batter low condition
Vinay Kumar sindhu,Thank you,Thank you amazon ‚ù§Ô∏è best offer and best product
Zein,Initial Review,"Laptop arrived in good condition, the outer packing had some bumps and cuts (I hope Amazon add a foam lining next time around since it's an electronic product) the tape was damaged and I had assumed possible temperament, but the inner package was safe and sealed.

Setting up the laptop right now and I don't see issues except for the display having variable lighting zones.
Speakers are alright, keyboard feels alright for office/school work.

Seeing it has a Ryzen 5 5K series chipset, I belive it can run gaming titles up to 2019-2020s at the lowest settings. Though i recommend you that you buy a gaming laptop if you're looking for the exact application.

I'll update the review after a week of use.

Update*
I've noticed the fan sounds like a jet engine at times. I guess it's a norm for the cheap price but it would've been better if the engineers could come up with grated outlet at the back, we don't mind if there's a gab between the display and the body.

The display is below avg. Not recommended for someone who wants to do work related to colour perfection unless you but an expensive external display.

And as for the gaming aspect, It can run tomb rider 2019 at an avg of 30-40 fps at lowest graphics. If you're alright with that then go ahead with the purchase."
Mr.Foni,Average use,"As I used over 3 month, all features are quite good, it would be much better if have free MS office."
SrinivasReddy p,Good product,Good

Akshay,Budget laptop with sleep issues and poor support,"I bought this as a second portable laptop. I use a more powerful one as my desktop replacement. Let's go through the clich√©d pros and cons, shall we?
Before that I should mention the biggest issue I've had with this. It DOES NOT enter sleep state correctly.
The fan keeps spinning in windows and this will be a drain in the sleep state. There's NO updated BIOS as of now to fix that. In Linux it just hangs after trying to wake up from sleep.

Pros:
1. Good price
2. Surprisingly good build quality except for the keyboard which feels cheap
3. Decent number of expansion ports
4. It had a spare 2.5 inch disk slot which was not mentioned in the specs. Bonus expansion slot!
Cons:
1. Cheap internal components (Ram and SSD), though they'll definitely last the warranty period.
2. Stupid policy of not letting users open their laptop without voiding warranty. What do these people think we are? Lemmings?
3. Cheap BIOS with no features
4. No Drivers/BIOS updates on the website.

That last one is the worst, coupled with no BIOS updates which might have fixed the sleep issue. I did some investigation and the issue is that it's not going into ""s2idle"" state correctly and the BIOS only advertises that state. Windows somehow just keeps the fan running on trying to sleep which means it's going into S2 state and not ""s2idle"" which is supposed to replace S3 state.

The BIOS is very cheap and basic with no options to control sleep states, SMART reporting or other advanced features. You can at least expect sleep state control. In Linux, I'm having to use hibernate instead which works if I turn secure boot off, but it's slow.

I would avoid this brand in the future and advise others to do the same. Extremely frustrated with the experience."
girijashankar,Keypad is very bad.,"Features of this laptop is attractive but screen quality is not good , view angle is also not good, and worst thing is the keypad , right shift key is small and postion is also not good , keyboard is not practical , very difficult to use , i suggest not buy this this one , just because of keyboard ."
,Walue for money,But display angle is not good
Sameer kumar,It is lagging already..,"I received this laptop with open( teared amazon box) but since laptop was untampered I let it go. Firstly, this is my first laptop so I'll just type in my experience.

It is lagging even to run prince of Persia ( which is a small game,) ..

Also there are constant lags even which doing simple stuff on this laptop.

There seems to a problem, it takes a minute to wake up from sleep mode and power button keeps blinking....I think it's an issue

Battery doesn't last well...it comes to 30% with only 3 hours of usage, but since it has a fast charger it gets charged quickly.

There is no backlit keyboard, and screen is worse... it'll have to be at a certain angle to view things clearly.

performance is good ( as I only used ms edge so far, yet I experienced lags while closing and adding new Tabs. I'll update more with time.

Prakhar,Speed is awesome,I get Laptop in good condition.
,Nice product,"Use for study purpose and for coding

Ajay,best at this price,I am using this for trading purpose and the laptop is fine only if Backlight keyboard was available and delivery was too long. otherwise it's fast machine 16 gb ram is awesome
Get today nice product üòÉüòÉ,Value for Money Purchase at rs 37000,"Good Build Quality - Keyboard material is not as good as it must be
Speakers have low bass and volume, shrill audio quality
No Heating or reboot issue as of now ie 10 days
Best specs for the price"
DT,OK as per price,User experience is not upto the mark as compared to competition. Quite a few things could have been better just with common sense. I really like its overall look and feel and thin and light profile. So price vs quality and experience is ok.
Placeholder,Average display poor sound,"Performance not that much for being an i7 processor. Windows 11 consumes average of 8 GB out of 16 GB with Outlook client and 4 tabs open in browser .

Though it is a SSD feels like normal hdd.

Acer can do much better for this price segment"
Ishwarlal C.,Good,Happy
Ravi Gupta,Suddenly Display got stuck while running,"Don't buy this product, this laptop suddenly stops working while doing some basic work. After that you have to do manually poweroff and once turn off the laptop you can't turn on the laptop, no matter how much amount you try to turn on this laptop. After 2 days it will be fixed without doing anything. You come across this problem several times."

If you are purchasing this laptop. If you want to purchase a laptop, then you may regret purchasing it because it is a very good laptop.under 35000 ryzen5 with graphic cards / 180 hinge design/ hdd and SSD both storage/ metal body/ HD cam/üëçüëå"
,A perfect product at a great price of Rs. 35000,"I would say a good buy for the asking price of Rs. 35,000 including GST. You get 16 GB RAM, 500 GB SSD and relatively latest Ryzen 5 processor and to top it all Windows 11 OS. The only thing missing is MS Office for which you have to shell out extra, that is if one requires MS Office."
Indus Corporation (India),Best for gaming,Due to performance this laptop is value for money. This laptop (16GB) smoothly runs GTA V in 1080p with 40fps and Valorant in 1080p with 150fps average. I did not expect such a performance.
Placeholder,Decent laptop works well,Best in this price range (30k) came as it was listed as the back had metal finish and looked premium and is very fast
