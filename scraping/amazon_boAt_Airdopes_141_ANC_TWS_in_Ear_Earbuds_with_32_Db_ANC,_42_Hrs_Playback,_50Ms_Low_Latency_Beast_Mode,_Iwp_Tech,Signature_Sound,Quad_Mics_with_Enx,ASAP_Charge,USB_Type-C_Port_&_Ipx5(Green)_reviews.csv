Supraja nayudu,Using since 13months,"I am using this for since 13 months, Initial momths it worked well, everything was fine but right now i feel the battery is getting weaker and it is always getting disconnect and the right earphone is not fitting into its pod, it keeps popping back but it is getting charged. I don't think it will work properly afte next 4 months. This product is not recommend for rough usage. This best part of it is its quality, but the inner quality doesn't last long and bot friendly for rough usage.
These are some Pros and Cons
Pros :
Good sound quality
Battery is good
Amazing product quality
Cons :
Gets disconnected for every 10 to 15 min and then gets reconnected after 20 to 25 sec.
Doesn't work while running or in moderator wind.
I am not a rough user, I use it everyday for 2 to 3 hrs only, so for me i felt it is right investment for 1100 rupees. Overall I am happy with its performance.
My rating for this is 3.9/5.0"
Ashik Latheef,good product,"Title: A Reliable Choice for Wireless Earbuds

Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)

I recently purchased a pair of true wireless earbuds, and after using them for a while, I can confidently say that they offer a satisfying listening experience with a few minor drawbacks.

Pros:
1. Sound Quality (★★★★☆): The sound quality of these earbuds is impressive, with clear highs and punchy bass. They provide an immersive audio experience, making music and podcasts enjoyable.

2. Comfort (★★★★☆): The earbuds are comfortable to wear for extended periods. They come with multiple ear tip options, ensuring a snug fit and good passive noise isolation.

3. Connectivity (★★★★☆): Pairing is straightforward, and the Bluetooth connection remains stable. The earbuds quickly connect to my devices, which is convenient.

4. Battery Life (★★★☆☆): The battery life is decent, offering several hours of playback on a single charge. The charging case provides additional hours, making them suitable for daily use.

Cons:
1. Build Quality (★★★☆☆): While they feel lightweight and compact, the build quality leaves something to be desired. The plastic construction feels a bit flimsy, and I worry about their long-term durability.

2. Touch Controls (★★★☆☆): The touch controls can be a bit finicky. Sometimes, accidental touches occur when adjusting the earbuds, which can be frustrating.

3. Microphone (★★☆☆☆): The microphone quality is below par, particularly in noisy environments. Call quality suffers, and it can be challenging for others to hear you clearly.

4. Limited Features (★★★☆☆): Compared to premium models, these earbuds lack some advanced features like active noise cancellation or advanced app integration.

In summary, these true wireless earbuds are a reliable and budget-friendly choice for those seeking good sound quality and comfort. They are a suitable option for music enthusiasts and casual users. However, if you prioritize durability, advanced features, or crystal-clear call quality, you might want to consider higher-end alternatives."
Dillip,great product under low price range,"Pros:
1. The level of volume it gets to, is just awesome, it can get incredibly loud so if you're at the gym, these are perfect.
2. Awesome Bass!
3. Noise cancellation is just great, if you simply put them on without even any music playing, u won't be able to hear things around u very well, it's great for places like Gym.
4. Lovely battery life, I've had them a week and only had to charge the case once, that too for just a few minutes. And the earbuds themselves, leave them in case for just five min and you'll be getting battery for a long long while.
5. They are very comfortable, can be used for long periods of time.
6. Affordable!
7. The touch controls are very responsive, tap to pause, double tap right one for next song, double tap left one for either rewind or previous song. Can also pick up calls just by tapping.
8. Multiple ear coverings are provided with it.
9. Type C port

Cons:
1. The sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc. The bass is the highlight so it's great for music, but for movies or gaming, you won't get the most crisp audio.
2. Some connectivity issues, sometimes i have to turn my Bluetooth on and off many times for it to work (this is occasional, not a daily or frequent occurrence) [Edit after 1 month use: it's now a very frequent issue]
3. The mic quality is good if you are using your phone, but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on PC
4. Sometimes on WhatsApp, the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds, so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes. (Not an issue if you are the one dialing) i hope it's just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issue.

Overall, I needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there (lol) so I'm very very happy with them
Highly recommended for music and/or as a more affordable option as compared to JBL etc."
Parth,True review after a week long use .....,"I am writing a true review after around a week long use of these boat airdopes 141 ....
CONS
1. the mic is average and the voice feels a little modulated on the mic provided .
2. the case is little bulky due to longer battery life but you will get used to it in about 2 to 3 days. The case quality is decent but the case lid feels like its built out of crappy plastic and doesnt feel robust or stable in hand.
3. these airdopes are based on bluetooth v 5.0 and later and they will work great with all the devices having the same bluetooth version i.e v5.0 or newer however in case of older versions there is a lot of latency lag. I personally use these with my laptop that has v5.0 and they work great however when i connect them with my android phone which has bluetooth v 4.10 , the experience is horrendous ... there are many problems like latency lag, voice breaks etc even when the bt v.50 is backwards compatible .... i experience this latency lag and voice break during calling , whatsapp calling and playing simple mobile games. Despite all this there is no problem while streaming songs on these airdopes.
4. there is a lot of voice leakage if you use them on 100 percent volume both on laptop and mobile phones you will have to tweak them ... the voice is also kind of high so you will not be able to listen to anything on 100 percent anyhow .... 50 to 60 is an ideal level for all the movies and games as well as music.
5. Your ears will hurt after prolonged usage of these if you dont select the right size of air caps ... 3 sizes are already provided inside the box.
6. The biggest con while using these airdopes on windows is that you cannot use the airdopes and the inbuilt mic together .... windows doesnt allow it even if you try very hard to use both the mic and airdopes output speaker together Its a windows issue but is manageable .
7.Another big problem is that the voice control option is absent on the airdopes and the volume cant be controlled from the airdopes ... you will have to control it from the device which is also a big problem .

PROS-
1. the sound quality and the bass are great .
2. the battery life is great you can easily use them for 7 to 8 hours on continuous usage.
3. They charge very quickly, in a jiffy.
4. They feel even greater if you enable surround sound while using them on windows platform.
5. the connectivity is great too ;as soon as you open the case they will automatically detect and connect to the available devices that you paired them with earlier within seconds.
6. There is literally zero latency and zero lag on these while connected on the same bluetooth version .... i used these on my laptop and played all the games like cs go, valorant, gta 5, and other games but there is no issue while gaming or music.
7.There is a support for mono audio and you can use one airdope at a time instead of using both.
8.Boat has provided a year's warranty on these so they can be easily replaced in case of a damage if the damage occurs within the given time frame .

Overall the product can be optimized a bit more but is still good to use now and is a decent purchase on this price point ; however better options are available if you intend to use it just for calling purpose , better go with something wired or something that comes with older bt versions if you intend to use them with devices with older bluetooth versions ."
,My product use time experience,"It was good, but lasts for only 8 to 9 months at most. In my case, I got charging issue as the pods were not able to charge from the case and I was no longer able to use it again. In the time I used it, I got pairing and connectivity issues sometimes. The pods would automatically disconnect in the middle of nowhere and I had to turn off the Bluetooth on my phone and on it again multiple times to connect it again. Just so you know that my Bluetooth on the phone is not at all a problem cuz my phone is perfectly alright and pairs well with other devices I connect.

I am giving only 3 because, It can improve more in terms of case quality and its charging fearure to bots cuz mine was that problem. One more is the pairing and connectivity issue. Also call quality can be improved. BUT I must say that the sound quality is exceptionally beyond my expectations. It was extremely good to the point that I am addicted to this product even though it has many demerits. It was a great time using this product.
Thank you!"
Harish Kumar,Great product,"My first impression on this product was okay-okay but quality of the sound was greater than my expectation at this price.

Pros: 1. Different sound modes
2. ANC mode is really good. When I working at office in this mode my neighbor colleagues were trying to call me (shouting) but I don't even hear a single word. 😀. This proves ANC was awesome.
3. Battery backup is really good.

Cons:
1 There is no volume control on pods.
2. The call answering button/touch didn't work well.
3. The sound when it comes while pairing was like haunting sound. They would have choose way better chimp sound.
4. Mobile app on iOS didn't work.

If you are only focusing on pods for good music go for it but you are a person who attend more phone calls this may be little annoying."

Abdul khaliq,"Battery Backup, Calling quality","Value for money in this price range as I bought in Rs 1500 . Battery backup is good, sound quality is good and calling is average but as price it is good"
Kamal Dubey,Good but there is are other models batter than this,"I recently got my hands on the boAt Airdopes 141 ANC TWS Earbuds, and overall, they've left me quite impressed with their performance and features.

Let's start with the positives. The active noise cancellation (ANC) feature is a standout, providing a significant reduction in ambient noise, which enhances the listening experience, especially in noisy environments. This makes them great for commuting, traveling, or simply enjoying music in a bustling cafe.

Additionally, the battery life is commendable, offering up to 42 hours of playback time with the charging case. This is particularly convenient for long journeys or extended listening sessions without worrying about running out of battery.

The design is sleek and modern, and the earbuds themselves are comfortable to wear for extended periods. The touch controls are responsive and intuitive, allowing for easy playback and call management without having to reach for your phone.

However, there are a couple of areas where the boAt Airdopes 141 ANC Earbuds fall short. Firstly, while the bass is decent and adds a punch to the overall sound, it may not satisfy bass enthusiasts who are looking for a more pronounced low-end response. Similarly, the voice call quality is average at best. While callers can be heard clearly, the microphone does pick up some background noise, which can be distracting during calls.

Despite these minor drawbacks, the boAt Airdopes 141 ANC TWS Earbuds offer a compelling package with their ANC functionality, long battery life, and user-friendly design. If you're in the market for wireless earbuds that strike a balance between features and affordability, these are definitely worth considering."
Radhashyam,Great Fit- Great Sound Quality only with Anc and some basic feature deficiencies which can be fixed,"Got it at Rs.1599 during one of the discount days which is good. 1799 for this product which is the avg selling price is high. Rest assured sound quality, comfort and build is great. Touch functions and features are user friendly yet what stands out is the sound quality which works very well with ANC. Without anc:trash. These buds do not support volume touch control which is offered in other brands as a basic control feature but if you are okay with that these are great tws earbuds. These are not supported in the Boat Hearables app but whatever kaam chal jata hai. I switched from noise to boat as noise has an average product life of 1 year after which it gets discontinued and thereby cannot be serviced they just close your ticket as they have no spare parts, but boat seems to have a longer product stay life which allows me to get more repairs out of the same product thereby more time of use once purchased. It's a good purchase for 1699 also, 1599 was a steal deal but not necessarily worth it for 1799 as no touch controls and no app support. If you have a budget of 2 to 2.5k then choose better ones in the market."
Abdul Muyeed,Good for high range games and decently good clarity.,It's for those who want decently good clarity and loud base (when Boat Signature Sound is turned on). Anc also works impressively good. It's also suitable for people who play high range games and want low latency (50ms). If It's for online tournament games it performs quite good after turning on the beast mode (gaming mode) and it actually gives only 50ms(milli seconds) latency only which is good and if it's for daily online tournament gamers who want perfect sound with best latency you can check out other airdropes too. By the way these airdrope's beast mode is no less than costly TWS ANC i mean it can give good experience as costly TWS ANC. I have both the airdropes 141 with and without ANC both are good and this TWS ANC is added with Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and low latency is increased. The way of packaging and Looks of this product feels quite premium too. I've ordered black one and it's just too good looking than most of the costly TWS ANC.
Amish Thaker,Does the job,"Pros:
- sleek and sexy
- gets the job done
- no problem with phone calls / music etc

Cons:
- The biggest probelm I have with this one is that often when I put the headphones back in the case it does not disconnect so that's a problem. It's a 50/50 thing. Sometimes it disconnects and other times it does not. Not a big deal but definitely not great. I have to manually turn off the headphones."
Muhammed Aneeq Sambrath,Its great but has some flaws,"This product is great only few issues i have with it like alot accidental touches happens and sometimes i have tap it more because sometimes the touch doesn't register and the amount of time you have to hold the eaurbuds to power on should be criminal,battery is decent and sound quality is great but for my personal liking i had to tweak it a bit but now i love it"
Kindle Customer,Sound and overall,"Bought this at 899.
Build quality- super good. Look is also good.
Colour- white buds accumlate dust on it, especially on the lines, the joint as seen in the pic.
Sound quality- Sound quality is good in this price range. Almost equal to the normal earphones.
It does not have noise cancellation so does not give a premium feel.
Battery: A fully charged case can run for around 6 days. (I bought it 15 days ago).
Fitting- Fitting is perfect. Does not fall out easily unless your cheekbones function.
Touch control- Touch control is the best part. You can pause, play, change songs and even youtube videos."
,Best for Bassheads..Balanced sound is not upto mark,"Pros:-
1. ANC kind of works, good for blocking indoor noises such as fan and AC
2. Featherlight build, more on that later
3. Good connectivity, no issues with that
4. Great battery life.. With volume around 50-60% ANC on - buds: around 5hrs with case ≈30-32hrs depending on volume and without ANC increased by 0.5-1hr battery not close to advertised levels

Cons:-
1.Balanced sound is a gimmick, I've used several hires earphones with balanced sounds and had my expectations low but this managed to let me down further. Everything sounds tinny and hollow with no real warmth or quality to it. Seems like the drivers are turned to be bass heavy at factory and no amount of EQ tuning could bring them down to normal. Disappointed as I love balanced > bass heavy mode. Others might disagree as everyone seems to love bass in excess.

2. Featherlight build(again) the case and buds feel fragile compared to the original boat 141 which felt like a tank.

3. Can't use custom eartips apart from those in box as the case won't close with any eartips other than those given,used a boat 141(original )with custom Sony eartips ,they were perfect and was disappointed by the lack of support for this product

4. Transparency mode is not good enough

5. ANC fails at higher ambient sounds, passive cancellation on the old boat 141 was better compared to the ANC on this product

It's easy already crazy high how much bass majority of us Indians love, But nowadays it's reaching extreme levels, People who love and are used to Balanced audio on hi res earphones avoid them at all costs. Bass heads will be very much satisfied."
Gokul B,Sound,They fit in the ears very well hence the outside noise reduces . Makes talking and listening very easy
Shweta Sriwastava,Good quality,"These ear pods have best quality and the sound base is nice too . Worth the money , no issues regarding charging or connection."
jeevitha shree,First day impression,"First day impression is good, yet to evaluate on it’s durability"
Shankar,Very Robust,One of the earbuds fell from the 19th floor. Zero damage
Nishit Garg,Awesome product at this price,Bought it for rs 900 and it's working perfectly great... can't expect more for this price...
Harish kumar,Sound quality,Good product must buy and sound quality is superb battery backup is good
Durgasivatejaachanta,I think it's not worth for 1800 rupees,"The sound quality is amazing, means when you listening songs or movies or something you feel like clear punch sound, but It won't getting bass, so, when your intention is to watch some action movies or something you will get clear sound with excellent punching, but at the same time uou feel like something is missing i.e. Bass.

And I don't know about remaining boat earpods weather they are also same like this or not.

Calling
To be honest, The calling experience with these earpods was little bit bad, means opposite person getting some disturbance or some breakage at my voice,

Comming to Active Noise Cancelation for calling.
When I try this feature, it canceled my voice also along with the disturbance, due to this opposite is can't hear me properly.

In one line calling experience is not good for me.

Fitting in the ear : Super

Touch Controls :
When we are trying to talking out the pod from ear, sometimes it automatically changing the mode or pause or play the song... May it is because of that stem design.

NOTE/TIP : Don't switch the modes always.

In simple words, it gives top notch sound quality with little bass."
