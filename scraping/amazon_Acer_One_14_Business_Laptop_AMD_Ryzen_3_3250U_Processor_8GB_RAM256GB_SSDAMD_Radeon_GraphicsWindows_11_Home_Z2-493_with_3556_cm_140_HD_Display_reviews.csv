Sunil nagle,Good,Very nice prodect
Nitish,Budget laptop,this laptop is good for day to day use not for Heavy work... but there's an issue in ssd maybe every time i go to restart it gives me a blue screen warning and it keeps on restarting forever untill i turn it off by putting it into shut down mode.
,Software problems,"The windows 11 has update issues, seems like they've provided with an inactivated windows. The windows security also keeps on crashing. Would have given this a 5 star but the problem is frustrating."
Jojob L.,Performance is excellent if downgrade to Windows 10 !!!!,"With pre-installed Windows 11, the Laptop performed slow but after downgrading to Windows 10, it worked fast. No issue with sound, display etc. Overall performance is good and recommended for students as well as professionals who are not doing much video editing work."
Gautam,Arrow keys too small,Performance is good. Arrow keys on the keyboard are too small. Sound is also low.

Mukesh Kumar,Great laptop in this price,I purchased this laptop onbehalf of my friend. And so far its providing the great response. I think we got the best price during the current Amaon Sale.
Sabahal Mubarak,"Product seems good, but supplier cheated","Product seems good, but supplier cheated. Supplier removed original charger, and kept a duplicate cheap quality charger. Better check product unpacked before leaving delivery person and return if see any cheating. Supplier Name is Appario Retail Private Ltd. Please avoid the same supplier for any purchases."
Srj,"Good product , Value for money.","Overall performance is üëç
When it get little bit hot aftrr the charging, the fan starts to make louder sound also within few minutes it becomes silent.
Totally fine product."
,Value for money,Battery life 4 hours. Build quality is not very good. But good in budget range.
Abu Noman,Quality,Value for money
Amazon Customer,Good Laptop,It's a good laptop for whoes has no income source and low income source . You can run gta v on low setting on 30 to 40 fps it's. Is good üòä I feel good when I play my favourite games such as re7 or re2 remake and re4 on standred setting it's too good
Jogendra nonia,Screen (display) not so good.,Display has not got good contrast. Also fan is making noise even if cpu not heavily used.
Mukesh Kamath,Built as a PORTAL DESKTOP not a LAPTOP,"This laptop has been built that such that without the charger plugged in (AC INPUT), the CPU is slowed (throttled) to 400 Mhz. Basically rendering this laptop useless without a charger. Not even Windows 7 will run on this without a charger.

You cannot override this setting as it is at the chip level.
They have also instituted h2O Bios, where we have limited control over the product.

For a country like India where the power can leave at any point.
This product is useless without a constant power supply.

This is a poor build, and it seems like ACER lazily reapplied some chip settings they had designed for another product on this one without any quality checks."
Jan Swasthya Technologies Private Limited,Nice,Good
MANISHA,Too loud. Not worth the money.,Makes noise. You cannot work while plugging in the charger. Too loud. Its a below average laptop. Do not buy. Expensive for its price.
Placeholder,Good for daily office work,"I have been using this laptop for many days now. I am hereby giving my review
Screen:3/5. The viewing angles and screen quality are average
Battery: 3/5. It lasts 4-5 hours if not connected to internet and using at 50% brightness.
Sound: 3/5
Performance: 3/5. I use it for my daily office work, browsing and movies. But with multiple windows open, it hangs sometimes and there is a visible lag.
Build: 3.5/5. It is entirely plastic. It fell once from table height and just a small piece chopped off. There was no damage to screen or hinges.
Keyboard: The typing is comfortable. It is usual with acer to have pg up and down keys close to the arrow keys which could be a problem sometimes"
Naseem Mohammed,Peripherals don't work,"i am not able to hook any peripherals into this laptop. No mouse, external monitor or speaker.
It is very poor in performance, even though i got onoy basic appliction running on the laptop."

Prathamesh patil,Flop,"Flop model

Placeholder,Loud fan on cooling,"Fan is too loud n sounds like airplane landing. Also fan triggers often. Mouse pad also feels twitchy. Not a solid feeling laptop unfortunately.
Very awkward keypad."
Upendra Bapat,Efficient laptop for day-to-day work,"The laptop is quite good for the type of work that I do. It is mostly typing and image editing. Starts up quickly. Battery back up is good.

There is no lag during browsing or opening new programs. MS office is pre-installed. I had my ID for the same so no need to download.

Overall really good buy at this price range."
