adarsh kumar,Samsung 32inch review - A Compact Marvel of Visual Brilliance,"The Samsung stands out as a commendable choice in the 32-inch TV category, offering a perfect blend of compact design, impressive picture quality, and smart features.

**Design:**
The TV's sleek design is both modern and space-efficient. The slim bezels enhance the viewing experience, drawing your attention to the vibrant display. The build quality feels solid, adding a touch of elegance to any room.

**Display Quality:**
Equipped with a high-definition display, delivers crisp and vivid visuals. The color reproduction is impressive, offering a lifelike viewing experience. The LED-backlit screen provides excellent brightness and contrast, making it suitable for various lighting conditions.

**Smart Features:**
Samsung's Tizen OS powers the smart features of this TV, providing a user-friendly interface. Accessing streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and more is seamless, thanks to the built-in Wi-Fi connectivity. The intuitive remote control simplifies navigation, making it easy for users of all ages.

**Audio Performance:**
While the compact size of the TV limits the space available for speakers, the audio quality is surprisingly clear. The integrated speakers deliver decent sound, but for a more immersive experience, consider complementing it with external speakers or a soundbar.

**Connectivity:**
The tv offers a variety of connectivity options, including HDMI and USB ports, allowing you to connect your gaming console, Blu-ray player, or other devices effortlessly. The inclusion of multiple HDMI ports is particularly beneficial for users with multiple peripherals.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the Samsung 32 inch tv excels as a 32-inch TV, catering to those seeking a balance between size and performance. Its sleek design, vibrant display, and smart features make it a worthy addition to any small to medium-sized space. While the audio could be improved, it remains a solid choice for users prioritizing visual excellence and smart functionality in a compact form factor."
,Great quality tv at a decent price but lacks alof of features,"NOTE: TV TABLE STAND IS NOT PROVIDED IN THE BOX. No Bluetooth support. Only wifi 2.4ghz is supported, no 5ghz wifi support. PICTURE & AUDIO quality is SUPERB. Supports dolby and hdr.
Buy this Only if u want reliability (samsung displays are very reliable and last long unlike cheap counterparts) , good picture and audio quality.

Bought the bezel less 2022 variant for 14,990 rupees.
Samsung is a reliable brand. Picture & quality is good. Although it's not a full hd 1080p display, at 32 inches its not apparent.

User interface is okay. Netflix app works smooth but prime video app is laggy. Tizen os is fine. So no google play store. Doesn't support chromecast, only supports Mira cast which is a different casting protocol.

Feature wise tizen os is bare minimum. But you can easily buy an android tv box to get google play functionality if u want to run android apps.

Brands like tcl, ifalconn, redmi offer more features because they run google tv\ android tv but their hardware is not reliable.

This samsung 32inches tv is great deal if u buy at 14k inr. Great picture clarity. Good sound quality. HDR works good. Samsung has great after sales customer service. So if u want good quality and reliable TV and don't care too much about having android tv os, go for this. It's a great product."
T Rex,"Smart features, Good audio and display quality","This Samsung TV stands out as a top-notch choice for anyone seeking a premium viewing experience. Its combination of superb display quality, smart features, sleek design, excellent audio, and versatile connectivity options make it a well-rounded package. I highly recommend this television to anyone in the market for a high-quality and feature-rich TV"
Ashish Khandelwal,Good product,Product price is reasonable and good features
kiranmai nagireddy,Worth it as wall mount stand received during installation,"I liked the product for the value for money, good picture and sound quality, Samsung plus included at no cost. Installation is free. Comments were confusing - some said no stand and some mentioned about stand. So let me clarify. There was no table stand or wall mount stand in the box (though the thermocol had a groove for table stand). The installation guy though bought the wall mount stand (free). He said the swivel one will be for 3500Rs which can be installed later too.
Resolution is good. It does not pixelate and works on wifi even with a n/w speed of 10MBps.

Cons: 1 energy star.
No clarity about stand. You don't get table stand in case you want to move the TV to another room.

Overall I felt it was a good deal. Originally it was for 13990 then 12990 and for some time it was for 11990. On top of it credit card discount of 10%. If you ar lucky you will get it at a good price."
Placeholder,Wonderful,Really Good Smart TV
,Missing parts,I gifted this TV but unfortunately there is no stand for table top or wall mount so please guide me for this my

Sanjay,Rating of product,Samsung mobiles and tv are good products
,Budget friendly,"A smart TV in reasonable price with all basic essentials.
Only issue I felt that responsiveness of TV is little slow because of 2 GB RAM.
Sound - Good sound without Sound bars.
Display clarity is also good.
Lack of technology- No Bluetooth
It supports only 2.4 GHz band
If your access point is 5 GHz only then that will issue but they managed it with RJ45 port.
It have HDMI port.
Will update more soon‚Ä¶."
