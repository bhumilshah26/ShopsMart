Placeholder,General performance,"As someone who's been using the iPad Pro for a while now, I have to say, it's been quite the game-changer. The first thing you notice is the stunning display. Whether you're watching movies, editing photos, or just browsing the web, everything looks incredibly crisp and vibrant.

But it's not just about looks. The performance of the iPad Pro is on another level. Thanks to the powerful processor, everything feels smooth and snappy. Whether you're multitasking with multiple apps or diving into some graphic-intensive games, the iPad Pro handles it all without breaking a sweat.

One of my favorite features has to be the Apple Pencil. It's incredibly precise and responsive, making it perfect for taking notes, sketching, or even just navigating around the interface. And with the addition of the Magic Keyboard, the iPad Pro can even serve as a laptop replacement for some tasks.

Of course, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. The price tag on the iPad Pro is definitely on the higher side, especially once you start adding accessories like the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard. And while iPadOS has come a long way, there are still some limitations compared to traditional desktop operating systems.

Overall though, if you're in the market for a powerful and versatile tablet, the iPad Pro is hard to beat. Whether you're a student, artist, or professional, it has something to offer for everyone."
IBK,Very bad experience with apple product. Its like they forgot Quality check.,"Lines on screen left side. Feel like very poor quality check at apple. After spending 1.4L we get a poor quality product. No return possible. Have to visit apple store to get it foxed. Imagine a 2 day old product has issue.

Never had such issues with any other company."
Gaurav,It's worth it.,"It's worth it,hands down."
Abilash,Camara very poor,Approach apple support for device replacement
Placeholder,Waste of money,"Very disappointing device. Continuous performance lags, app crashes and battery drainage."
Prem,Price is too High,Better to go Old model 2021 M1 chip.. it also perform good price is too high... Gays please don't buy this for BGMI because it is banned in India.
Vidhi,Pick the right size,"I got 12.9 and I would really consider Weight, how it fits in bag, the wt of the keyboard if you buy serperately too. If you need to open multiple docs together, or need more view surface for editing or arts thing, get 12.9. Otherwise for basic operations, 11"" is fine too. I absolutely love mine, its awesome for reading my textbooks too it feels huge. 12.9 size works really well with liquid text so I'm happy. Go to the store, hold in your hand and see and then buy. Performance wise, it's the best ipad there is so ofc it's bestüëè"
,Very Costly,"It's really costly out of the reach of a common people. Earlier version was approx 70,000. Now it's more than 1 lakh. 30k will will just go to government as a GST."
Swaraj,Beautiful Product,The best gift i got from my boyfriend. Beautiful product. Video clearly is so good. So compack i can carry with me every where
Rohit Bansel,This thing has AMO LED Screen,This product is awful and lags very much and this is not reliable and it costs very much it is a waste of money and it's camera quality is very bad
Amazon Customer,Very Minor upgrade over 2018 iPad Pro,"I knew I was going to upgrade my 12.9' iPad Pro this year because my old one from 2018 is 4 years old now, and there were some very, very minor wear and tear issues about that one that bothered me. But honestly, I just slipped it in the same case, slapped a screen protector on it and transferred my data- and I don't feel any difference at all.

It's slightly thicker and heavier than the 2018 model, the battery life and screen brightness is significantly better, but I can't say the Mini- LED screen is much of an upgrade. Everything looked great on my old iPad, too, and this one has a slight blooming issue and a very faint shadow along the edges on a white canvas. Both are extremely minor issues but if I could choose I'd probably go with LCD and pay less since the 2018 screen was amazing and I have no complaints.

Performance wise- I don't notice a difference AT ALL. It might as well be my old 2018 iPad for all the tasks I do- drawing, painting and illustrating in Procreate, Clip Studio, Infinite Painter, Fresco, browsing on Safari, etc. Speakers might be a touch better than the 2018 model but again- only a tiny margin.

Honestly, if all they've done for the past 4 years is slap an M2 chip in there, add Mini- LED and Apple Pencil Hover, then the 2018 is a better buy if you can find it new and cheaper. I only give it 4 stars because the iPad Pro as it is was already an amazing product, well ahead of its time in 2018 and still a great device today. I dock one star for just how absurdly overpriced it is, especially after the antics they've pulled with the new basic iPad, making it UBC C but not giving it the new Apple Pencil 2. Basically today if you want a decent iPad with Apple Pencil 2, you'd have to go for the 256GB iPad Air, at which point you might as well step up to the 128GB base model 11' iPad Pro. It's the most aggressively Apple move Apple has pulled in a while, and I'm not a fan.

If you just want a basic iPad that doesn't break the bank I'd highly suggest looking around for an older gen iPad. If you want the 2nd gen Pencil then get either of the 2018 Pro's, they are both much better value than the M2. They still make you pay extra for the Apple Pencil and they've also removed the spare tip that came with it in the box.

If you don't mind giving up iOS specific apps such as Procreate, seriously consider Samsung's tablets this year. They offer a MUCH better value proposition. It's the first time since 2015 I find myself suggesting an Android over iPad, but Apple has really rested on its laurels. If money is no object then yes, the M2 iPad is technically the best, but absolutely nothing on the iOS platform can even come close to utilising the power of the M2 chip so it's a bit of a hollow win."
