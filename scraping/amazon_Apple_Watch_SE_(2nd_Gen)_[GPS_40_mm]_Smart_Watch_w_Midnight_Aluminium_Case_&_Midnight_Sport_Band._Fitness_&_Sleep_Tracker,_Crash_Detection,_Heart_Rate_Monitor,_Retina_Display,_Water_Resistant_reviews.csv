Akhil,Great product,A great product from apple as always. I love this thing . The only thing i don't like is the battery life of it. The battery is horrible. It barely lasts a day but other than that the product is fire. Must buy!!!
Bappa,Great entry level watch to enter Apple world garden .,"The Apple Watch SE is a great entry-level watch to enter the Apple world garden. It has all the essential features of an Apple Watch, such as fitness tracking, heart rate monitoring, and notifications, at a more affordable price. It's also a great way to experience the Apple ecosystem and see if you're ready to invest in a more expensive model in the future.

Here are some of the things I love about the Apple Watch SE:

It's comfortable to wear all day long.
It's easy to use and navigate.
It has a long battery life.
It has a variety of features that are useful for everyday life, such as fitness tracking, heart rate monitoring, and notifications.
It's compatible with a wide range of Apple Watch apps.
Overall, the Apple Watch SE is a great value for the price. It's a great way to experience the Apple ecosystem and see if you're ready to invest in a more expensive model in the future.

If you're looking for a great entry-level Apple Watch, I highly recommend the Apple Watch SE."
,Best Smart Watch for Apple Eco Sys Beginners,"Very professional smart watch which does it job as per expectations. 44 mm dial is also impressive. Sync with iphone is fabulous. Two complaints are :-

1. Despite being a globally popular brand, No apple watches could connect whatsaap calls with iPhone..Surprisingly all the cheapest smart watches around could do this. Not even Apple Ultra watches could connect whatsapp calls is simply not acceptable from Apple.

2. Battery back up could be improved to minimum 2 days. Now it need to be charged every day.

Rest it‚Äôs a good buy."
LJ NAIR,Great for first apple watch,"As an IT professional and someone who tends to overthink things, I have thoroughly researched and reviewed the Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 44mm GPS-only model through various sources such as reviews, videos, and blogs. Based on my findings, I have come up with the following considerations for whether or not you should buy this watch.

Reasons to buy:

If you are a first-time Apple Watch user, this model can provide you with important data to determine if you really need an Apple Watch or not. This model has enough features to help you determine if you love or hate the product, so there's no need to buy the top-spec watch right away.
The Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen 44mm GPS-only model is affordable compared to other Apple Watch models. While the smaller size is more budget-friendly, I personally needed to get the larger dial due to my wrist size.
The watch has most of the essential features and the latest processor, making it more than enough for your needs.
Reasons not to buy:

If you do not like to charge another device, this may not be the best option for you. However, the watch can easily last a whole day on a single charge.
Overall, I would highly recommend this watch as it delivers what it promises without any major cons. Apple products are known for their quality and reliability, so there's no need to worry about functionality. While I have only used this for a week, my experience as a long-time Apple user gives me confidence in my recommendation."
himanshu,Superb one,Item is very nice and working well
,best smartwatch for the price during offers,"Best Smartwatch for the Price during sales with offers ,also because its apple and for those who own iPhones specially for the young people who dont need ECG . easy to use, good tracking on point connectivity with other devices and saves my time to decide even if I need to take out my phone if I receive a call or not by just a glance on the watch when the phone rings ! I agree cellular one also has its no benefit but in my use I usually dont leave my iPhone behind so no regrets at all for getting the GPS version of the Apple Watch SE"
soumya,Good faster,Good faster and smoother
Anirudhan V Nair,The product I received is original,It is perfectly original product I received from Amazon
GANGADHAR PANDEY,Expected better battery backup,"Everything is fine except battery backup , Keep in mind if user needs to make use of this device potential and apple needs to improve products , Battery back up is needed so that it doesn't dry out in mid of the day or next after a full charge . So i would expect 48 hrs of backup atleast , So that i remove this from wrist only to charge during having Food or bath or after i get up from bed in the morning."
Reetika,The size is small for male,"Size is somewhat smaller for males. I would suggest to go with GPS watch 8. 44 mm or bigger.

Initially I thought cellular would be a big thing but its 1 in 100 times scenario when cellular comes usefull. Avoide biting cellular and go for GPS. You won‚Äôt miss it."
vivek tiwari,Apple Watch SE2,"Cons : thick bezels, slow charging and always be on display feature is not their
Pros: works well you can use it full day in a single charge and you still have approx 25-30 % battery
Same processor as series 8 so it works super smooth and calling is also great"
,Worth it..üëç,"Go ahead if affordable, battery life is pretty less.

Accuracy level is good..

Over all good product ..‚úîÔ∏è"
Placeholder,I love my watch,"Bought it after contemplating for 1 year and have been using since 4 months.

Has all the necessary features and feels lightweight, touch response is good. Battery life is 26-30 hrs on average and I use for sleep tracking too.

Has a big community on reddit.

Bang for buck."
Ankit dubey,Accurate heart rate Reading,I have used another company fitness band with apple watch. It shows accurate reading of heart rate and Calories burned during my workouts. Only thing which I do not like is battery. I have to charge it daily.
Jay,SE 2 gps 40mm,"I really liked this watch,a good entry into I watch just loved the features and watch interface just loved it‚ú®‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è"
Sai Kamal Naramsetti,"40 mm is too small , 41 mm is good",40 mm is too small for size
Tushar Rai,Favorite accessory ü´∂üèº,"I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on this Beige Apple Watch SE version for a while and couldn‚Äôt wait any longer.
Loved the packaging and got it in a day!!!
I love how it tracks my stand hours, exercises and walking.
If you are here to get this one you know the drill, I‚Äôm not going too much into the specs.
I also bought a dark colored strap in case I want to spice it up some days üí´"
üå±chippieüå±,Loving it‚Ä¶,"It still holds good in 2023.

I have given my thoughts on the product, hope it helps while making the choice.

In terms of battery it lasts a day or day and half depends on usage.

Charging is too slow.

Display is good, but is not always on, which actually saves the battery and lasts one and half day."
,Not sure,Battery life is short
Kiran,Awesome,
Ashok,love it ‚ù§Ô∏è,"Its my self gift
sometimes self gifs are precious‚Ä¶
the starlight looks good for women
and the white looks good for men"
,Best smart watch,Best smartwatch purchased ever
Nehal Patel,It‚Äôs good,"If you want an Apple Watch and don‚Äôt want to break the bank, this is just the right watch for you. The only thing I miss is the keyboard and always on display from my old s7 but everything is good hell even better. Battery lasts a mile longer than my dad‚Äôs s7 and the features that we get is the same as that of the series line. Good purchase tbh"
Roshinibala Kongbrailatpam,All must have features included,Nice buy in budget
Viraj Keluskar,overpriced product,"dont think it's worth buying for this price...
very small screen size
poor battery life
no allways on display
overrated and overpriced"
shan,Not fit for Men.,"I would recommend this 40mm for girls and 44mm for boys but the major drawback is it‚Äôs battery.
It only lasts upto 15-20 hours. And you have to charge it daily.
Though I have reselled it to someone else on OLX."
ANKIT GOYAL,Best for iPhone,"If you have an Apple iPhone, then Apple Watch is the best side kick for it. Seamless integration and great performance.

Only catch is that you have to charge it literally daily, but that‚Äôs OK since you can put it on charging stand in the night.

Good tracking and useful."

Ayshath shahina TM,"Working Good, Battery 16 hrs In normal usage","Only battery is the main concern, battery gives only 16 hours backup if it is just on for watching time.

Quality and Size is excellent for thin wrist."
Sanchita Srivastava,Battery Life biggest flaw,Everything is outstanding except the battery life. pathetic battery life
Ashwin Gowda,Amazing product,Worth buying it!!
Navneet Sharma,Best Device for entry level,I bought this with a confused state of mind as I don‚Äôt have a big issue of budget but never experienced an apple watch before. This watch don‚Äôt come with AOD and loop strap band which I was looking initially. Rest of the features are too good. Spending 20K for AOD and later to save battry life keeping it off doesn‚Äôt make any good sence.
Kannan,Really good,I bought this product only for gym and jogging purpose. This product does what I was looking for. I got it for 20k. Good deal. Only thing which I didn‚Äôt like is it automatically tracks my bike ride also as cycling. Not sure how to change it.
Amazon Customer,Amazing experience for 1st time users,Apple never disappoints with the product‚Äôs quality and sturdy experience. Everything is upto the mark. The only drawback i found is about Battery life. I have to charge it everyday so that it can be used for the another whole day. If you want all the features to be active on your watch you need to carry the charger every where you go.
ARINDAM RAY,EXCELLENT,EXCELLENT
Aashi Shrivastava,Battery Backup,"Excellent watch, improved battery backup."
Arif khan,a must buy...target price 17K...,"really good device. a must have if you have an iPhone. really good and accurate device.

cons:
only one that battery life could have been better. but yes you can cope with that as its apple."
A.S.Bandyopadhyay,Excellent price,"It‚Äôs needless to mention about the product quality as it bears the guarantee of apple but Amazon gave it at an unbelievable price. With all offers I got it for 18450(approx). It‚Äôs the 40mm gps version and that‚Äôs enough for an average user unless you indulge in professional activity. It gives all relevant information that can be expected from a smartwatch in fact a little more with an exceptional accuracy. Only down side this version dose not have the spo2 monitor but then it‚Äôs not required most of the time. Display is adequately bright and legible the size is not a constraint.
But Amazon took a bit too long to deliver the item may be due to the sale and even prime didn‚Äôt helpüòÄ. But thanks to Amazon for offering such a quality product at this rate."
,I will say most asked questions on Google,"1. Yes it can connect to any headphone you want. But you can‚Äôt change the EQ. It has it standardised. It sounds awesome with EarPods of course. The sounds on other earbuds are surprisingly good. I have tried with JBL, soundcore, sony, realme etc

2. You have cellular GPS version? Keep the phone off and you can make the call directly from your watch."
s,SE Watch,it‚Äôs an amazing watch it helps me track everything from my sleep to my exercise to how many steps I have taken how many calories I have burnt. I love this watch
Sagar sen,Awesome,Play Video

Farhan,Good product,Original product and nice product
Abhijit Kavi,Apple is always the BEST,Simply Superb
KALYANAM RAKESH,Good produt,"Good quality, Touch screen is good and 40mm size is not suggestable to any one coming to battery life upto 8-10hr for me."
Bhavya Sharma,Nice watch but don‚Äôt buy if u are android user,Nice product
,Nice product,
Ravi Rathore,Apple‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,Very nice product and easy to handle.
,Colour,I like but prise
sourav arora,Best affordable watch,"The packaging was good but watch battery was dead out of box. Had to charge for a hour to get it turned on. Working seamlessly after that. Got it for 18K on sale and it‚Äôs totally worth it.
It integrates with iPhone really well. Only drawback is no fast charging and to full everyday and sometime in the day have to top up to survive 24H."
