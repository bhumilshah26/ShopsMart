Bushan,Best for an average user.,"Go for this without a doubt instead of the 14 pro or previous ones. The camera is really the better one than all the previous versions. If you‚Äôre willing to give up on Always On Display, High Refresh Rates (iOS is optimised and you won‚Äôt feel any difference if you‚Äôve never used a phone with high refresh rates.) and a Macro Lens then this is the one. The feel in hand is also amazing, you wouldn‚Äôt know unless you‚Äôve held one. Type c is also a game-changer than all the previous versions."

Praveer janoria,15 review,Hey amazon I bought this new but it mke prblm hngg and some touch not work send me number so I exchanged this
Amazon Customer,Check the model number first,I had received i phone 15 which was refurbished instead of new one so be careful before ordering it r check before taking the delivery after taking the delivery it‚Äôs too difficult to get refund if u get also Amazon has started the park a part of amount in Amazon wallet in of full refund so guys be careful.
"Pathetic item, worst quality not as shown in picture, laces are too thin , poor quality‚Äôs",Worst experience,Worst
Jyothipallavi gandla,Worst ! Worst !,"Worst quality phone refresh rate is not good
full heating while charging
This model was not up to the mark better to choose other models like 13 and 14"
Sanjay Gulati Musafir,Recommended,"Recommended for those who are obsessed with Apple products. I'm not. Bought it for my wife. She is happy, so am I."
Mohnish,Always Good,Amazing and Cute
venkeswararao,Worst camera,"First time I have purchased iphone 15. Expected good camera, but it is too bad. Too much noice in photos in indoor lighting.
My another phone poco x5 pro capture more clarity photos compare to iPhone.
Disappointed. Never expected from iPhone product like this"
Aditya Kashyap,The picture Quality,"I really love the quality of the snaps , every ry single snaps from I phone 15 is just waawii"
,Loved iPhone 15,I am an apple user since 2017. Ever since I have not looked back. It is getting even better day by day. And iPhone 15 has a lot of features which I always wished the previous would have. For example it comes with a C-type charging wire. So I wont get dissapointed when I ask a non - apple user for their charger. Also the night mode camera is love. The battery lasts whole day. Overall I loved it.
Piyali Das,Hiting problem in i phone 15 too much,Hitting problem when I am using 15 mintes. No no safe while usingi
,Worst experience,Don‚Äôt buy this device from here.
Saad Asad,Good buy,The temperature of the phone is getting higher after using it for mire than 15-20 mints. But the heat is not 'out of expectation' level. Good phone.
Nishat,"Heating, Bad battery backup","iPhone 15 is getting heat in even 15 min of video calls.
It supports only 14 hours of battery backup in Normal use. It‚Äôs not up to the mark."
Amruta Dwivedi,Good phone,I like it
Siva,Best iPhone of the year,"If you don‚Äôt like using big sized phone , go for it. One day battery life for above average use. Camera is good. Video is excellent, call reception is excellent, screen is really smooth ( if u have never used 120hz). Gaming is smooth although I won‚Äôt recommend for long and heavy gaming as it would drain the battery. Charging is quick. If you use 20WT APPLE power adapter then you would notice heat while charging. Then goes back normal after getting charged above 70%. In hand feel of the phone is really good. Base model itself feels more premium like pro models. Type c is really a good addition as it creates more functionality. Screen is really bright and visible even under direct sunlight. This is by far the best upgrade of base model iPhone in years. GO FOR IT!"
RS REDDY,I dnt like this,Heating issue.. 15 min video recording.. full heating mobile.. some laaging issues.. 25K android mobile is much better than this phone.. only buildup purpose u can use this..

Yuvraj goyal,Phone is not start,Phone is switched on
Phone received in dead condition Amazon do not give any support,Good phone But heating issues,Hi‚Ä¶ I ordered new IPhone and received it yesterday‚Ä¶ heating a lot ..while transferring files from old phone
Anant Pokhariyal,Good performance,"Upgrading from iPhone 11 to 15. Good one full day battery from 85% to 30% for normal users without gaming.
Use apple adapter for good battery life.
Camera images were very natural..
Good sound output.
For first week usage you may feel heat.. Then no heating issues so far."
Venkatesh,Good,Good
,Well it's better than 14 series have to give it thatl,The phone itself feels extremely lighter than the previous series and feels les venerable to falls the camera improvement are beyond nice..
Waseem,Bad purchase,iPhone 15 hangs even after the software update
Anup,Hardware crash and poor after sales,"The iPhone 15 hardware (mid system) failed after 2 weeks. I went to the service center they are repairing the phone from last 1 week but not replacing it with a new one.
Poor quality phone hardware and overall bad apple service experience. Not recommend!"
mohan kumar,Money wasted,"Don't buy this phone, go for samsung instead will give overall good experience. Samsung S24or S23 is sufficient for daily media consumption and photography"
rakesh babu,Very poor,Very poor
Alpana soren,It's works very well,It's a good product
,Iphone Lover,"Amazing, we were looking for green color it's like share ka fal metha Amazing we loved it. Good in everything quality, battery and picture quality as well. This is first iphone of our family. It is really amazing. Quality of pictures and premium look best thing of this phone"
Lavibindal,Best and must upgrade over older models,"Phone is overall a beast specially in terms of battery and camera it has improved a lot, display is also brighter compared to the old ones, a little upgrade in processor too and dynamic island is an add on to it which looks cool and will give you feel of a pro.There is nothing much difference between 60 and 120 hrtz considering the price because 60 hrtz of an iphone is much smoother than a android one.
Im using this device from few days and only problem im facing that this phone is heating specially when you are updating to new ios so dont worry it happens when you update to newer ios.im Using 20 watt charger and its performing very well to my phone with little warm feeling which is normal due to fast charging.
Dont think too much about battery health because you have spend a lot for this tech so use it without anxiety to its highest capacity."
,Please check and take,I recieved a used iPhone the box was already unboxed and not sealed and there were minor scratches on the screen as well as back please check serial number and verify it on Apple website
Shubham s.,Trashhhhh,"I phone is trash don't buy it, it's too expensive, and u don't even get charger and it's too damnn expensive I would love to buy Samsung phone it has better screen quality, camera, looks legit"
Parth Patil,iPhone 15 A solid upgrade and value for money,"I am from Android(Samsung flagship phones) background. Comparatively , Build quality is good, Camera are superb. Speed is good. Security is designed well.. So far things are working fine for me. But few simple feature are not available in IOs which is little frustrating."
Stalon,Great product.. Value for money,Just feel the product..It is great product and experience.
Chander shekher,Upgarde version of 14plus,Looking show good
Prasanna,Worthy,Superb üëå
Subham N.,not worth what we pay,"problematic structural integrity , would want to go for ip14 series. the tag titanium literally makes no difference , cheaper steel is much better while it gets bent over impact protection the glass, absorbing the shock, while titanium will not abosrb any shock destroying the glass, another thing the cam module glass back used to be separate in iph 14, while in 15 its a single sheet, u guessed it right, they want u to spend more money on the back and front if u ever drop your phone"
Arshi khan,Got a brand new phone loved ir,Ordered iphone today. Loved the Amazon service. The model number started with an M and battery capacity was at 100%. Loved the color
Vipul Sharma,Best in the range,Best in the range

Worst product,iPhone XR to iPhone 15,"Just made the transition and here‚Äôs my POV on the first ~2 month of use

Pros
- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants
- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I‚Äôm transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here
- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it‚Äôs spotless
- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA
- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome
- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.
- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone
- Apples approach on Security!
- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawless

Cons
- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone‚Ä¶ including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up‚Ä¶.. works like a charm
- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchases

Industry memes
- USB C : honestly don‚Äôt give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It‚Äôs just a mode of charging for me and that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much
- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!
- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?
- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I‚Äôve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for texting

Tips of managing battery health
- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don‚Äôt need back ground refresh
- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up
- I charge my phone only using a power bank not direct wired or wireless charging
- Don‚Äôt let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%
- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service
- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section
- I don‚Äôt use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc
- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I‚Äôm recommending above

Vendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.

‚Ä¶.. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience"
