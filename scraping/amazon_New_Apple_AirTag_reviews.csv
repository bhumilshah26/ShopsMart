Ritesh chouhan,Best tracker in the world,"Apple Airtag is the easiest to track all your loved belongings range should be long but its okay works everywhere and for this you need only apple device to operate these.
Best quality product
Functioning justify the price
Got this @9870 in sale"
,A must have for essential,"This is a must for essentials like car keys, house keys, wallets etc.., it works just fine. I have found my keys twice after loosing, using air tag."
Srikanth,This thing is Very Durable,"Bought this for long distance travel luggage tracking. In which I could find the luggage very easily upon landing and it was quick too. People were spending 30+ mins to find their luggage. I found them after 5 mins. Now I use it as a functional keychain. I use it quite roughly. Going to work, keeping in back pocket always.. one day it was in the laundry machine by my silly mistake. Also put it in a full dryer cycle. Came out really hot‚Ä¶ though the battery is dead but miraculously it was working. Not a fan of Apple but this is good product."
Deep Biswas,"Useful to have, but not a must have",Works well as intended. It is not super accurate and it can takes some time to update if there are no Apple devices to ping location from in the vicinity.
,Very nice product,"Good to track your belongings
Recommended
Size is very small like button"
Promit Choudhury,Does the job,Does the job
AIKEIZ,Waste of money,"Please don‚Äôt buy , it just waste of money , trace only when find any iPhone Bluetooth signal, unless it‚Äôs shows AirTag is not reachable, and also not accurate , I purchased after watching YouTube videos, and after read reviews, but now I can‚Äôt return it because there is no return option , just waste of money, no use"
,Excellent,Good product

Praveen kumar,Worth it,It‚Äôs a value for money product and provides accurate information on current location and notifications on when left behind. Durability is very good.
Zyan,Quality,
,"Easiest pairing. Jack of all trades, but master of only some.","Very easy to pair. Pull out the plastic battery separator and bring it near an iPhone. Seamless pairing within a minute. Bought from Appario. Fast delivery by Amazon.
NOTE: The precision tracking is not supported in iPhone SE 2nd gen.

Not Suitable for pet tracking. Too big for wallets. It is good for keys and backpack/luggage tracking. If your iPhone does not support precision tracking, it is not work buying this now. Wait for the next model from Apple. Without precision tracking compatible phone, it does not have any everyday use, like finding your keys under a pile of things.

This works with iPhone Find My network, i.e. it uses other iPhone with Find My enabled to track all AirTags. So if you are living in remote places it is difficult to track stolen devices. If you have an iPhone that support precision tracking it is useful to find things that you dropped while hiking / trekking if you are within the range of the tag."
Rithwik,Works on bluetooth,Not a live tracker works on bluetooth
,Amazing value for the money product,Amazing value for the money product
Placeholder,Accurate tracking,"Update: Seller didn‚Äôt validate the purchase date for me nor did the amazon bill had warranty mentioned. Checking warranty on apple‚Äôs website asks for a valid purchase receipt so it doesn‚Äôt have the one year standard warranty currently.

The product delivered is original, sealed and intact.

Precise finding (iPhone 11 and above supported) works best when you are under 5m which can be narrowed down with the help of chime on airtag from Find My.

Ability to find a lost airtag is entirely dependent on the density of iOS devices. If available the location is frequently updated in Find My app."
Baljeet Singh,irritating device but works,"I use this for my wallet as I am the most forgetful 38 year old man in the world. I have kept this in the change compartment of my wallet. It sits there cosy but the speaker is not loud enough, the coverage is not good enough and the performance of the app is very finnicky. I am leaving it with 4 stars as it has saved the day for me about 4-5 times. Instead of spending hours searching for my wallet, i have managed to find it. Total saved time approx 4-5 hours so far. I wish it was louder, I wish it had its own built in connection to EDGE/3g/wifi so it didnt depend on my iphone too much. good device just needs polishing. Worth the money though."
SV,Not very effective in India,As population of iphones increases the effectiveness will increase. Low at present
Kanwar Anand,Valuable,Best in the world
vishnu vijaykumar,very good,useful
Moses babu Gutti,Nice,"To pricey ü´∞ before 1yr back it was 3k
Now 3.5k"
Guruprasath S.,Most accurate tag,I think no specific feedback required for Apple AirTag. Vey good and accurate one. I have been using it for the past 2 months and does what it says.
Shivam rana,Only for short range less than 1 km,Not work effectently
PPrasun,"Useless, just 30 feets distance coverage","It is not for gps location, only indoor or very less distance upto 30 to 40 feets using bluetooth technology"
Amazon Customer,Good not great,"So Basically the air tag is not a Solution for finding items which are beyond the range or perimeter of air tag and iphone.
The item can be only located if it‚Äôs a near to a distance of 10-15 meters only.
Also the beep sound is too low which can be only heard in complete silence.
Can‚Äôt be used as A PET tracker at all.
Also sometimes it won‚Äôt be able to located the air tag so you must be a closer distance within the Bluetooth of the air tag and your phone.
Little pricy as well since apples are expensive than oranges."
,Does as advertised,"Does what it's supposed to. The metal gets immediately scratched and advertises it's an apple tag. Best to disguise this as some idiot will think ""ooo he / she can afford this so what's in the bag will also be valuable"". Any of mine on display I've removed the Apple logo with a scotchbrite green scourer which you don't see the scratches so much now and also gives it a nice brushed metal finish :)"
Pete Draper,Definitely value for money,"The location is not as accurate as a SIM card based GPS device would be. But then, that‚Äôs the only problem. The pros far outweigh the cons. It‚Äôs compact. Is not dependent on a phone carrier. No monthly or yearly maintenance fee. Solid battery life. Sturdy built."
Srijit,Its not that great,"The product is great , but it doent always work, its okly useful if you wanna know approx location , if android phojes could have detectdd it, it would have been great"
VM,The Apple AirTag is very good and very easy to use‚Ä¶.,The quality of the product is very good üëç and you will also like it too‚Ä¶.. but the problem in this is the range it‚Äôs not good‚Ä¶.but except those it‚Äôs a good product with exceptional quality ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ and much more
Soumya mondal,Nice product,Play Video
,This a useless product from Apple,"This product doesn‚Äôt show the location after I lose the connection, this just waste of money

If you see the video you may understand"
Abhishek,Apple is great as always,No need to write any reviews because it is apple we are talking about. Never ceases to surprise me.
,Good,Nice project
Placeholder,Limited use gadget,Using for a fortnight but very very limited use. Only upto 4-5meter on straight line without any obstruction it is useful. It should have been more powerful even at a high price.
Amar verma,Not solve the purpose,As it is not showing real time location this product is of no use.
Subir,Superb,Nice product from Apple
Amazon Customer,Good,Worth the buy if you are too busy and cant keep track of important daily usables
Arun,Works well in a Apple phone environment,Good product .. but it can send signals only when a iphone is near by. Also it takes time to show up in the map
haresh,Don‚Äôt buy it for GPS/live tracking purpose,"It is only meant for finding 0 to 10 or 12 mtrs range immediately. If you want to use it for tracking (vehicles) live it won‚Äôt work, as it is updating its location once or twice in 5hours in my observation."
Mahesh Shinde,Only work with iPhone,It is good product. But it is only work with apple iPhone. Also it gives hint if you keep item out of range and when you reach near to object 5 m near only gives actual direction.
Heena,Good,"Thank you for delivering before time. The product is good, gifted it."
Kaustubh,Finally it‚Äôs Apple product,"As compare to size of the product the sound quality is really good
Can locate accurate point I love this product"
,Good,Useful product if u can use it
Mufaddal,Made my life easy,The accuracy and ease of use is so convenient! Never losing my keys again because of this.
Pratik Patil,Not upto mark,"It will show location only if in contact with other iphone, disgusting."
Sandip Sankpal,SEAL WAS BROKEN AND AIRTAG WAS ALREADY LINKED TO OTHER iPhone,SEAL WAS BROKEN AND AIRTAG WAS ALREADY LINKED TO OTHER iPhone
Abhishek Singh,Okay,It‚Äôs cool to be in apple‚Äôs ecosystem
Sreehari,Technology at it's Epitome,"The performance of the airtags is based on how many iPhones are there in the region you use. More the number it is easy to track. So in country like India it works perfect in the Urban environment, but slightly becomes less effective in rural areas."
,Waste,"We have to pay Rs.3400 to buy the AirTag but is it doesn‚Äôt shows actual location where it is you have to put in lost mode so that it will connect to the another Apple device, that device will get notification then we may get that tag"
