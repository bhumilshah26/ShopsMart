UFxKevin,Value For Money,"I have recently bought the Asus Vivobook 16 and I must say it's a very good budget laptop for daily basic usage and especially for a student like me. It's Intel i3 1215u processor handles basic tasks like PPT presentation Excel and net surfing very easily. It also has a decent display of 16 inches to watch movies and videos on.
It also offers a fingerprint scanner which is a very good thing in a budget laptop. One thing which I think is missing is the backlit keyboard at this price point otherwise the laptop is very nice and I would recommend you to buy it for daily usage and basic gaming ( Not heavy games like pubg gta v etc)"
,"Battery, Screen, Resolution, Performance all top level","This laptop is best choice under 40k...if you have knowledge of using laptops.

I bought it for 34,990 under Great Indian Festive Sale.If you're smart enough, this is best budget laptop that you can buy.The screen shows a little bit negative images which again doesn't matter as long as you're not looking at it from a weird angle.

Doesn't have backlit and thats good because it saves a lot of battery üîã.
Battery is soo good. In watching 4k video for 1 hour it drains only 20%.
The product is genuine.

If you want better experience just buy a wireless keyboard AND a 65 watt power bank cause that's the only thing which feels cheap but only OCCASIONALLY!!!!!!
Build quality is more than enough. Not like those overrated honor or mi laptops. It has plastic but the quality is actually nice.

If you are smart enough, buy this laptop and a seperate monitor with the money that you save and all your cons just turns into pros.....

Go for this laptop its good ,its fast , its reliable.
I did my research before buying it and believe me its really satisfying laptop.

And last thing i have i3-1220p with blue color and its not distinguishable from black colour if not under strong light.

The processor is better than 11th gen i5 and 13th gen i3."
Mayank Sharma,Awesome Laptop!,"The sleek design, powerful performance, good display, and good battery backup make it a standout choice. The high-quality build and innovative features truly elevate the user experience. A solid 5-star rating for this outstanding device!"
,Bad quality from asus,"I had trust on asus thats why i had purchased this laptop. But I have to visit service center 3 times for this laptop within one month of purchase. Although they have repaired it under the warranty but who likes to take new laptop to service center. First problem was it was not starting so service center guys said it is charger issue then they fixed it. Again after 1 week i faced the same issue. It was not starting this time they said it motherboard issue and changed the motherboad. Again after receiving my laptop from service center on the same day at evening the screen was not turning on although laptop was on and screen can be seen when connected to other display. This time they said it is issue of display and they fixed it.
Within one month of purchase i had to visit service centre 3 times. Laptop was in service center for around 15 days out of 30 days. I hardly got any chance to use it properly. My experience of new laptop is completely ruined and I don't expect anything from this laptop now. I'm completely frustrated. As of now it is working fine but can't say when new problem will appear. Fingers crossed. Very disappointed with asus brand.
P.s. - I have purchased this laptop after lot of research and comparison as it have i3 1220p a very powerful processor but before I test this laptop to its full potential have to face so many issues."
Placeholder,Just OK. After use of 4 days.,"Body finishing is best. Design is cool looking superb üëå. Keypad also good. Its backlight keyboard is impossible. Operating speed also good. But....... But.....

If u r looking for a better display then don't go for it. Its display looks like LCD display. Very poor quality display. If u just bend ur display then u can't see anything. And its second disadvantage is is battery backup. After full charge u can use maximum 2 to 3 hours in normal use."
,Very nice,
Shubham,Best for daily use but battery is not sufficient,"The ASUS Vivobook 15, powered by the Intel Core i3-1220P 12th Gen processor, delivers a commendable performance. The 15.6"" FHD display provides crisp visuals, and the slim design adds to its portability. With 8GB RAM and a spacious 512GB SSD, it offers smooth multitasking and ample storage.

The integrated graphics are suitable for everyday tasks, though it may not handle demanding graphics-intensive applications. The inclusion of Windows 11 and Office 2021 enhances productivity, and the Alexa built-in feature is a convenient addition for voice commands.

The fingerprint sensor adds a layer of security, and the lightweight design at 1.7 kg makes it easy to carry. The blue color adds a touch of style to the laptop. Overall, the ASUS Vivobook 15 is a well-rounded option for users seeking a reliable, mid-range laptop for daily use."
Suresh Goud,Good,"Really good laptop, but screen could be a little better"

Ramesh,Great choice at 40000 for a basic use laptop,"I bought this laptop for my dad and am impressed by its performance and sleek design. Here are the points that I liked and which helped me choose this laptop

- 12th gen Intel Core i3 processor is a very good upgrade and ensures smooth multitasking.
- The 15.6-inch full HD slim bezel display offers crisp visuals, enhancing the overall viewing experience.
- It weighs 1.7 kg - making it very lightweight and also with a sleek portable design it is really easy for my dad to carry around.
- Comes with PCIe Gen 3 SSD which is very fast - 7 seconds to boot to Windows ( see attached video )
- Decent battery life - average 4 hours while using Chrome, youtube
- Fingerprint sensor for faster login

Here are some shortcomings

- The refresh rate is limited to 60 Hz
- No backlit keypad
- There should be a 1 TB SSD option since there is no option to add a second HDD/SSD
- Webcam Quality is unsatisfactory

Overall if you are looking for a laptop for regular use and don't have gaming as a requirement this is a solid laptop at 40,000 budget"
Rohan,1 month of use...,It's going smooth... After sales service is good.

Rajaneesh,Keyboard Backlight problems,"All specifications are value for money but there in no keyboard Backlight so I'm kind of disappointed with this product

Placeholder,A great choice under 40k,"The laptop is a great choice under 40k. Been using the laptop for more than a month and no complaints till now. The i3 1220p processor is very powerful. Works very smoothly for normal use and coding as well. Ram has to be upgraded for better performance but not required for normal use.
Pros:
Backlit under 40k
Great processor
Latest connectivity (wifi 6)
Boot time very less
Love the my asus software
Avg battery life (4-5hrs on normal use but ~3hrs on heavy use)
Cons:
Decent screen quality (looks like tn panel is used)
Decent sound (good sound if equalizer is used)
Note: The silver colour variant has backlit but no fingerprint reader while blue variant has fingerprint reader but no backlit"
,Good beginner's laptop under 40k,"Good laptop under 40k. i3 1220p is better than older i5 processors from 11th gen..I think it will be great for students for daily use laptop.

Cons:
1)Average screen quality and has very bad viewing angles.
2) Very Poor battery life....I am getting 2 Hrs max for normal web browsing and even less for casual gaming.
3) Screen has slight flex to it.
4)You cannot play AAA games on this machine at good quality cause there is NO GPU.
5)Speakers are bad .
6) No backlight on keyboard
7)Only 1 ram slot and only 1 SSD slot...NO HDD slot.

Pros:
1)Big Screen with good screen to body ratio.
2) Good keyboard with good key travel.
3) Has Numpad and Fingerprint sensor.
4)Camera privacy shutter.
5)Good number of ports.
6)Lightweight(1.7. Kg approx)
7)Comes with Windows 11 and MS office 2021 and Mc Affe 1 year subscription.
8)180 degree hinge.

If your main work is Video editing,Image editing or Gaming don't buy this laptop..It is for casual users and students...It is not for professional work and it has very bad battery life.
I got it slightly under 40k with card discount."
sarath,Performance OK.. Poor display quality,"Performance is amazing.. It boots in just 5 seconds.. And it has preloaded ms office also..

Only negative is the display.. If you bend the screen to 180 degree you can't see anything on screen... Such a poor quality display it is... üòîüòî"
Subhankar Roy,Processor,Very nice üëå
S.s,Good laptop,"Pros:
Fast processor (better than some 11th gen i5)
Backlight keyboard
Upgradable storage and ram
Cons:
Average display( poor viewing angle)
The pre-installed os won't allow you to boot up first time unless you connect to wifi and open a Microsof
The cpu is underclocked
180¬∞ hinge is absolutely useless, the screen will look rubbish at 180¬∞
The biggest cons is that build quality is very cheap, if you open the screen the body of the laptop flexes under pressure .If you are typing ,the laptop just bends under the little pressure from your hand .

Would i recommend?
No, even though the hardware is mostly good , the build quality is very cheap and it won't last long , spend a little more and go for some good brand like dell ."
Placeholder,Poor battery backup,Asus vivobook 15 i3 1220p laptop battery drained very quickly within 1 min 1% battery losed even for multi media consumption. This battery backup only for near about 2hr or less depends on working .
ayush raj,It's good,"I have been using it for 3-4 months now, it's working fine, no heating issue , only con I guess is the battery backup is little less 2-3 hours , otherwise it's a great optiom under 40k"
Mohammad Irfan,Very nice asus,Good verking
Amazon Customer,Alexa is not supported,"Amazon has mentioned in its site that Asus Vivobook 15 has built in Alexa support but when I ordered this laptop and checked, it does not have Alexa, I am not satisfied with this."

Placeholder,40 gb storage occupied by pre installed programmes,"Hi,
I received Laptop yesterday. In c drive already 40 gb out of 520 gb is occupied by preinstalled programmes. Pls revert if this is general practice by Asus?
@asusxustomercare"
Gourab chakraborty,Performance beast under 40k,"Bought it at 35k....at this price this is one of the best options.

Processor is very fast.
Gpu is very weak.
You can not play games on this laptop it is best for your everyday tasks & productivity works.
Display quality is very good.
Speaker volume is low.
It has backlight keyboard & don't have fingerprint sensor.
Battery life is decent....nothing extra-ordinary.....depends on what type of work you are doing.

Overall it's a good laptop for everyday tasks....and portable. General operations are very smooth, laptop is very fast, boots under 6 secs. I haven't faced any major heating issue."
Komal Varshney,Nice laptop,I bought this for own business use. I am using now it is too good at this price segment.

,i31220p,"nice laptop under 40k . it worth buying if your budget is less , i3 1220p is best"
Ankit Tiwari,Its hang a lot,Worst product
Abhishek k.,"Good Processor, below avg everything else.","USP is processor 1220P.
Display, audio are below avg.
If performance is not of high priority, one can go for OLED screen & better audio option in ASUS itself for 45k.

RAM needs to be updated for better performance. Not required for normal use."
Vibhin,BEST LAPTOP FOR STUDENTS......,Bahut hi achha laptop hai. Price bhi kam hai.
