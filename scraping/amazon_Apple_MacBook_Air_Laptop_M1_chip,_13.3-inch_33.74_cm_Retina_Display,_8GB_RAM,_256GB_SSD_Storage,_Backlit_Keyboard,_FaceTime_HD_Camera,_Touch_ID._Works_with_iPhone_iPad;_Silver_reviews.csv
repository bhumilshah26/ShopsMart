Sumeet Taneja,Mac M1,"1. Performance:
The M1 MacBook Air is incredibly fast and efficient. The M1 chip's performance is on par with or even surpasses many Intel-based MacBook Pros, making it one of the most powerful laptops in its class. Whether you're a casual user, a creative professional, or a developer, it handles most tasks with ease.

2. Battery Life:
One of the standout features of the M1 MacBook Air is its impressive battery life. Users report getting 12-15 hours of real-world use, which is a significant improvement over previous Intel-based MacBook Air models. You can go an entire workday or more without needing to charge it.

3. Fanless Design:
The M1 MacBook Air is fanless, which means it operates silently. This is a big plus for those who value a quiet working environment.

4. Portability:
The MacBook Air remains one of the most portable laptops on the market. It's lightweight, slim, and has a high-quality Retina display. Its build quality is top-notch.

5. Compatibility:
The transition from Intel to Apple's M1 architecture meant some software might not be immediately compatible. However, Apple has made substantial progress in optimizing and making software compatible with the M1, including popular applications and operating systems.

6. Rosetta 2:
Apple's Rosetta 2 technology allows older Intel-based apps to run on the M1 Macs, and it does so quite efficiently. Still, some applications may not be as optimized or as fast as native M1 apps.

7. Price:
The M1 MacBook Air offers excellent value for the performance you get, especially when compared to some Intel-based MacBooks.

8. Integrated Graphics:
The integrated GPU in the M1 chip is impressive and can handle a range of tasks, including photo and video editing. However, if you're a professional video editor or a gamer, you might want to consider a MacBook Pro with dedicated graphics.

9. Limited Port Selection:
The MacBook Air features only two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. This could be a limitation if you need more ports.

10. Upgradability:
The M1 MacBook Air is not user-upgradable. So, you'll need to choose the right configuration at the time of purchase."
,Totally worth the money.,"Ideal laptop for office / personal use except gaming. No lag, no hassles, great battery life, lightweight and sleek and looks like a charm.

Perfect device for customers who are not into extremely heavy editing and gaming."
SWAPNIL,I love MacBook Air M1!,"It is an amazing experience to own MacBook Air M1. It is designed for both entertainment and office work.
Pros:
1. Bright and clear Retina Display that can be turned off if listening to only audio, also display adjusts itself to surrounding light to give clear display.
2. Clear stereo effect sound for which you will fall in love.
3. Battery life is exceptional, easily you will get more than 10 hours and fast battery charging - takes less than 2 hours to fully charge from less than 10%.
4. Touch pad swiping options are excellent that makes your work very productive.
5. Very light weight and handy, can hold the laptop in one hand easily and can open the laptop screen in one finger!.
6. No lag or hanging even while running any games or apps.
7. Smooth key board with backlit keys that changes its light intensity based on the surrounding light.
8. No fan noise. Basically there is no fan so how can one get noise from it?
9. Strong build quality made of aluminium body.
10. Beautiful colour, looks and finish of the laptop body.
11. Airdrop, screen sharing, FaceTime Calling, Blue tooth connectivity features are amazing.
12. Inbuilt screen recording feature, photo and video editing features are great.

Cons:
1. Some keys are missing in Keyboard compared to Windows laptop.
2. The laptop surface is very slick and the laptop slides on your lap or in your hand, so better to use a cover to avoid sliding.
3. Occasionally you may feel some heat from the laptop
4. Lack of some ports like USB 3, HDMI, SD Card etc.,

I was bit hesitant to buy MacBook initially because of the Operating System and compatibility with other apps/software. But after I bought it I am loving the Mac OS and got MS office installed on it easily. Also, the deal under 70K in the recent Amazon Big Indian festival was really worth.

I am using iPhone from last 15 years and I never wanted to switch over to Android phone any time because I know what is iPhone!. You will know what is iPhone only if you own it and just like that without owning
MacBook you will never know what is it and once you own it you will never go back.

You will miss the amazing creation of Steve Jobs if you don't own a MacBook!."
Dayakar Devaru,This is awesome,"I am writting the review after using it 2 months
Good things
1. It is very fast
2. Its finger sensor it aslo very fast
3. It is very light weight
4. It is easy to travel with it
5. It is unbeatable in performance
6. It is fully metal body
7. Its metal finish is awesome
8. Its look is awesome
9. Its 8gb ram works more efficient than 16 gb ram of other laptops
10. If you are a student want it for coding then just go for it

Bad things
1. In base variant It has very less storage and it is also not upgradable after purchase. And if your try to get 1tb storage before purchase it will cost extra 40000 which is very expensive so you needs to buy a external ssd or hdd.
2. It has only 2 ports so you also need to buy a connector which will allow you to connect more things
3. it's screen catches dust very quickly so you need a anti dust screen gaurd for it"

M1 chip Performance (coding, multitasking):

DaVinci Resolve project (1080p)
15 Safari tabs with 4K YouTube videos playing
VS Code with a deep learning project
PyCharm project
Android Studio with emulator

Spotify
Zoom
Apple TV
Discord
WhatsApp
Chrome with Stack Overflow tabs
Asphalt 9 (high settings)
Minecraft
All of these apps were running in the background while you played Asphalt 9 and Minecraft, and both games ran lag-free and smoothly. Even after quitting Asphalt 9, Minecraft continued to run smoothly with no lag.

all of this with only 8GB RAM because it uses swap memory(internal SSD)
Battery backup:

It's a go-to for any business trip, school/college work machine that will last 10-12 hours with hardcore usage
Video playback is around 14 hrs
With normal usage expect 18 hrs as promised by the company
I did machine learning and deep learning work on it, and it only heated up very slightly, not much.
multitasking 30 apps at a time with no lag issue all apps run very smoothly

Cons

Ports: Limited 🔌
Games: Many games don't support macOS 🎮"
Placeholder,Very stylish and sturdy,"From the day of opening till using its felt amazing

1) Looks and build is very very good
2) performance is super breez, amazing battery life, very less heating.
3) but it is for light use only when opening too much apps ram usage fills very easily."
,"Excellent performance, great battery","I got my product delivered earlier this week. My first impression was that it is thinner than I had anticipated, which is great. Looks sleek, but is very powerful. Though I admit I haven’t done much expect some streaming, browsing and document creation work, it has worked flawlessly so far, with absolutely no lag. I would say that despite only 8 GB, it would beat any 16GB, Core i5 PC hands down on performance.

The display is good though if you have used an FHD LED display, you may notice the difference, especially the black colour. But it is not a major issue.

The biggest advantage is the battery. After the first full recharge, I used it for around 14 hours before I charged it again with 24% remaining. This could be the single-largest attribute in its favour. The keyboard looks premium and keys are easy to use.

In summary, a great choice even in 2024. I would like to see how it performs on some light programming / compiling activities, but I am sure it will perform well there too. Very happy so far."

Jaydeep,"the best laptop, period.","the macbook air m1 is the simply the best laptop one can buy, i used both dell inspiron and hp pavilion gaming, but the experience which im gertting is mind blowing. I want to point out that the display quality and sound quality is miles ahead of any other laptop in this price range but my favorite feature is 'instant switch on'. I wont go back to windows laptop now"
Amazon Customer,"Product good, Amazon festival dissappointing",Product is great. Ordered during Amazon great Indian festival! the ordered failed multiple times. Now it finally delivers altho at a higher price.
RAMSINGH YADAV,Got this in Just 63k - (3K amazing credit card cashback),One of the best laptop you can get in this budget and it is just a beast.
,amazing must buy,got it for 63 k ! great deal for such a great laptop would buy even for one lakh not he best for gaming but great productivity laptop however if you have a slightly higher budget i would suggest buying m2 air or m2 pro but this is the best laptop and cheapest apple laptop you can get in the annual sales
Amazon Customer,Got it for a banger of a deal.,"I bought this laptop for a steal price of 70K Flat. Delivery was within one day, all legit packing , warranty and works like a beast. It’s almost going to be 3 months - battery life - around 7 hrs if you are going to do solid work straight.
Overall - Highly recommended to buy in 2024. Unless the M2 comes down , this laptop is a steal but only if it’s under 70K!"
Merv,The best laptop better than windows in this segment,"Very nice product but there is a con
The m1 screen can break even with a single chips very fragile display 🥶 but overall the aluminium build is strong"
GAURAV,Great device even in 2023 (if under 70k),"I have faced 2 incidences of intense heating, in one case vs code, 10 tabs chrome, quick time 4k video, whatsapp, preview were running and a update was being downloaded or being installed in the background, in that case it got a hell lot of heated and i feared of it being damaged, I also faced battery drain while switch off and also in sleep in starting days, But it got fixed after the latest update,
I do not play games but when I tried playing an online browser based game venge.io I got 60 fps at high settings ,
But the second case of heting ocured when I tried playing Asphalt 9 on it, on default settings
(the graphics bar was going past the very high mode) it got so heated that I immediately deleted the game and ran my laptop infront of the ac(My 6 year old HP i3 7th gen U series laptop {with a fan} does better gaming on the high mode in asphalt 9)
Anyways I do not play games, I code , it great , and could not have been better for a college student who doesnt play games on laptop and only does coding, watching mosies and stuf, and college work
It
I do not use my laptop's speaker but they sound gr8 whenevr I had to 1-2 times
and one Important thing, camera are the best IF and only IF you are in well lit condition like rings or natural sunlight, in normal room light they are just like anyother camera you could find, it was really a disappointment because just for some college meets I could not but rings and have to attend meets from my room, so there is just way too much noice on my video and if anyone watches my video on full screen it just doesnt feel like mac's , it just feels some other hp, asus laptop.
I think there should be some fixes made in low light camer conditions on mac,
(For first few days i thought my camera was broken and was all set to claim the warrant but when i used it in outdoor and also saw one-two videos of indoor camera test, I came to know that it wasnt really broken)"
Pushpit Jain,Macbook Air M1,"The overall experience is amazing. The packaging and all was too good. I got it for 70k during 2023 amazon great indian sale. I couldn't get the card offer and the sale price for the prime members on 7th oct was 63k which would have been a great deal. But i could not get it. I have even seen people buying this product for less than 60k on the early access sale days. So please keep that in mind. So i bought it for a much higher price. If anyone is thinking of buying macbook air m1 then please purchase it, if its less than 65k on sale or something. More than 65k would not be great for this machine in 2024."
Apurva Waghmare,Awesome,Nice product satisfied
Nitish Kumar,"Impressed with Performance, Disappointed with Camera Quality - Apple 2020 MacBook Air","I recently purchased the Apple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop with M1 chip and I must say, I'm quite impressed with its performance. The M1 chip is a game-changer and offers unparalleled speed and efficiency, making it a joy to use. The 13.3-inch Retina Display is stunning and provides crisp, clear visuals that are easy on the eyes. The laptop comes with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD Storage, which offers ample space to store files and run multiple applications without any lag. The Backlit Keyboard is comfortable to use, and the FaceTime HD Camera provides clear video quality for virtual meetings.

One of the standout features of this laptop is the Touch ID feature. It is incredibly convenient and makes it quick and easy to unlock the laptop without having to remember passwords. This feature, combined with the overall speed and efficiency of the M1 chip, makes for a smooth and seamless user experience. Additionally, the laptop works seamlessly with iPhone and iPad, making it convenient to share files and work across multiple devices.

However, there are a few drawbacks to this laptop that led me to give it a 4-star rating. Firstly, the laptop tends to heat up quite a bit during intensive tasks, such as video editing or running multiple applications simultaneously. This can be quite uncomfortable and sometimes even affect performance. Secondly, the battery life could be better, as it drains fairly quickly during heavy usage. This is a bit of a letdown, as one of the key benefits of the M1 chip was supposed to be its efficiency and battery life.

Finally, the lack of ports is a bit of a drawback. The laptop only comes with two Thunderbolt 3 ports, which means that users will need to purchase additional dongles or hubs to connect other devices. This can be inconvenient and adds to the overall cost of the laptop. Additionally, the absence of an SD card slot is a bit of a bummer, as it is a commonly used port by photographers and videographers.

In conclusion, the Apple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop with M1 chip is a great investment and offers a lot of features and benefits, but it does have some drawbacks. It is a powerful and efficient machine that is great for everyday use, but it may not be the best choice for professionals who require more intensive applications. Despite the drawbacks, I would still recommend it to anyone in the market for a high-performance laptop that offers speed, efficiency, and convenience.

Bullet points:

The M1 chip provides unparalleled speed and efficiency
The 13.3-inch Retina Display is stunning and provides crisp, clear visuals
The Backlit Keyboard is comfortable to use, and the FaceTime HD Camera provides clear video quality
The Touch ID feature is incredibly convenient and makes it quick and easy to unlock the laptop without having to remember passwords
The laptop works seamlessly with iPhone and iPad, making it convenient to share files and work across multiple devices
The laptop tends to heat up quite a bit during intensive tasks
The battery life could be better, as it drains fairly quickly during heavy usage
The lack of ports, particularly the absence of an SD card slot, is a bit of a drawback"
Rajan Dimri,Still best in 2023 for developers.,"Writing review after 1 month of usage. I am a developer and purchased it for android and web development. while 8gb RAM sometimes may feel low but it doesn't make system slow. even if you are consuming 100% ram ( it does uses swapping like any other laptop does but windows laptop swapping is too slow) it doesn't feel like it is using swap. I use vs code, IOS simulator or android emulator, with bunch of chrome or safari tabs with backend server running with database and it doesn't feel like it's getting slow. everything works like you are using single application.
Battery backup is decent I am getting around 8-9 hours.

On the first time use it heated a lot. I thought the product has some defect. But after that it doesn't heated a lot.
Good in terms of keyboard, trackpad. I really loved the performance. Bought it during sale around 66k with card discount. If you are getting it below 70 go for it. Otherwise go with latest chips. M3 Air is also supposed to launch in the coming months. Wait for it.

Note: Good machine around 60 to 70k. If you have a good budget and looking for longterm laptop pick 16gb variant. SSD is fine 256gb is enough and you can use superfast external ssd's but ram cannot be upgraded later. So Consider upgrading ram if you are confuse in storage or ram."

mahesh arya,My 1st APPLE 🍎 product.,"In 64k , this is the best leptop for coding ever. Sound quality is very good as compare to any windows leptop in 100k, display and performance is also too good. But in 🥺3 months there is 97% battery helth remaining."

Senthilkumar,MacBook air M1,2023 me sahi hai.
Vikash Sahu,Worth the price,"Just love it. i am very much opposed to having iphones because its overpriced for its utility. But macbooks are just the opposite, there is no other laptop remotely comparable to macbook air. I got it for 62k inclusive of 1 yr extended warrenty. Best price"
Placeholder,Best laptop,This is the one of the best apple product in the market
Utkarsh Jain,MacBook Air m1,"Impressive Performance: The M1 chip is a game-changer in terms of performance. It offers significant speed and efficiency improvements compared to previous Intel-based MacBook Air models. It handles everyday tasks with ease and can even tackle more demanding tasks like photo and video editing.
Silent and Cool: The MacBook Air with M1 runs silently because it doesn't require a fan to keep cool. This makes for a peaceful and distraction-free working environment.
Exceptional Battery Life: One of the standout features of the MacBook Air is its remarkable battery life. Users report all-day battery performance, making it an ideal choice for students, professionals, and travelers.
Retina Display: The MacBook Air comes with a high-resolution Retina display, which offers excellent color accuracy and sharp visuals. Whether you're working on documents or watching videos, the screen delivers a fantastic viewing experience.
Lightweight and Portable: As the name suggests, the MacBook Air is incredibly lightweight and portable, making it a convenient choice for those on the go.
macOS Big Sur: The MacBook Air M1 is optimized for macOS Big Sur, offering a seamless and integrated user experience. It runs both Apple and third-party apps smoothly.
Quiet Keyboard: The Magic Keyboard on the MacBook Air is not only comfortable to type on but also quieter than previous iteratio"
deepak,Good buy,Working good and efficient.
Vishwanath Menon,M1 MacBook Air ( total value for money ),"This is a one of the best MacBooks for its price. It’s got the M1 chip and it’s a lot more powerful than you think. This computer should be more than enough for about 90% of the average users. I’ve also got the old intel based MacBook and i can tell you without a doubt that this M1 MacBook Air is so much faster in terms of performance and what’s more impressive is that it’s also fanless. So if you’re in the market for a new MacBook, I’d say go for it. You won’t regret it."
,Great product,Colour not available
Sayan,Best in price,
Arun dubey,Always best,Flawless and must buy
Manash Gogoi,Great one,"You khow apple is better for anything
Macbook is osm and the sound was great and the display is very nice to watch and movie and series
I have headphones but any time I watch movies on MacBook I don't use headphones because macbook sound was so good batter then headphone
Very good product but if you don't need so costly please not spend your money on it
If u flex the. This product for u"
Kaptan,Very handy to use,MacBook is really handy and very smooth working.
,Best laptop,"I have been using Macs since 2009. They are the absolute best... sturdy , reliable great battery etc it's the same with this mac air too.. it's a sep 2023 manufactured Mac air"
AnjuSingh,Value for Money,Excellent product. Worth every penny.
Shanks,Awesome built quality and smooth operations,"The build quality of this Macbook air M1 is in true sense very good. The best part is the Aluminum body, it feels cool at your palm while typing. The navigation and operations are also quite smooth. If you are new user or have just shifted from Windows, it would certainly take some time for you to get used to the new look.
The only issue I have is that when I plug in the charger provided in the box, I can feel micro current being leaked and tickling my palms. So tried plugging in my mobile charger and there was no such leak of current. But still I continue to use the apple charger since it came in the box.
Apart from this rest everything is just awesome about this machine."
Amazon Customer,This review is for software Engineer,"Writing this review after 3 months of use and there is no issue with product
I am software engineer earlier working on windows and switched with mac and I can say it was good decision for me.
I can able to perform high end task with good speed and performance.
I got it at 63000 In Offers
I bought it for performance and longer battery it is
Beyond my expectations and got it at really good price.

Thank you Amazon 💕"
Gurpreet Singh Khera,Mac for a reason,Macbook air M1 is still worth to buy in 2023 . It has one of the slimmest and lightest bodies I ever seen . Fully metalic body . Keyboard and trackpad makes you feel the premiumness of the mac. Display quality is just awesome. But a bit small 13 inch . Sound quality top notch 💯. Slow charging 30w.
,Damage in boxing,"Everything is fine, bt the original amazon box was in a disastrous condition, with seal broken down, with the opening of the box torn apart, yes the laptop and the apple box was safe, bt this habit of dealing with box which contains costly electronics is bad, I'm giving you 4 stars for the same reason, otherwise 5"

Shiva,Just Ummazing,"What I liked is everything the display, speaker , the perfect body , speed , battery,quite decent for editing projects(Not for 4k) , coding , for any heavy multitasking....it's beast in this prize range absolutely stunner . Don't have a sec thought of other laptop as a student I will recommend to buy this and if you're are an engineering student must buy."
Placeholder,Best Laptop at this price segment,"If you are paying for this, apple is giving you that service too...

Pros -
1. Battery Backup
2. Speed
3. No noise bcz of not having fan
4. Low price in sales

Cons -
I don't think there may be any cons for this laptop, if u r thinking that screen size is small... don't wrry dude, i also switched from windows laptop and i don't feel any difficulties, even it is more comfortable than those laptops."
Satyam Raj,Electric shock,"When i touch the aluminium part of the laptop during charging mode, it shocks even in small amount. But this may cause a huge problem to small kids. Apple should upgrade from this problem. They knows that this happens, but don't want that people get this information on social media."
