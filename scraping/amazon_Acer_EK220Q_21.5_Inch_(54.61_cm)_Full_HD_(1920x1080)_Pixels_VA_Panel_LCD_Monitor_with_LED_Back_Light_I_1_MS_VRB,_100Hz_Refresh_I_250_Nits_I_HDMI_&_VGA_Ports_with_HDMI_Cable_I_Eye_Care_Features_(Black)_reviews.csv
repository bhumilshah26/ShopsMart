Ayan khan,Very nice product,Worth it
,Satisfied for the price,"I bought the 22 inch IPS version for 6300Rs and for that price, there really isn't too much to complain about. The image Quality is good and viewing angles are better than VA thanks to IPS. The display colour calibration is not that great out of the box and is tuned to a warmer colour palette. But this is easily fixable by changing the colour profile from ""warm"" to ""normal"". I would also recommend changing the default contrast from 50 to 60 and increasing the saturation in AMD or Nvidea control panels by around 10-15%. The best balanced setting for me was with colour set to normal, contrast at 60, Gamma at 2.2 and ""black boost"" set to 4. For gaming, the 100Hz works fine, response times were satisfactory but not great(you get what you pay for in a cheap ips panel). The only usable Overdrive mode is ""normal"" and the others are gimmicks. The ""VRB"" feature for motion blur reduction is a gimmick and is unusable so i just have freesync turned on at all times instead. My unit had some backlight bleed on the top and bottom right corners but it is only noticeable in pitch dark environment and didn't annoy me enough to ask for replacement. Overall, after some tinkering in settings for the right colours and white balance i was happy with it for the price i paid."

joshi,"I purchased it at 5500, Worth it..",Almost 6 month... No an single complains. alll working.
Xavier,Overall good,"Display: 4 out of 5 (great black levels)

I really like this monitor, especially for the price. The black levels are really good, making it perfect for watching movies and doing graphic design. However, it's not the best for gaming. But that's not a problem for me since I don't play games.

The stand might not look modern, but you can use a monitor arm from Amazon to make it look better on your desk.

Overall, the monitor feels solid and well-made. Just remember, if you don't play games, this monitor is a good choice.

I also want to mention that if you were thinking of buying the lg22mp68vq, don't do it. I had problems with that model, so I'm glad I switched to this one. Instead, consider the 22mk600 or the 24-inch version of the lg22mp68vq. And don't go for viewsonic monitors either, even though they have a long warranty. They tend to have poor screen quality and too much backlight bleeding issues.

In summary, if you're on a tight budget, this monitor is a great deal.

Cons :

No aux output, no speakers"
Pradeep,Delayed After Sale Support,"Update: the Engineer visited after 1 and additional 5 days for Monitor replacement. Was expecting better TAT. Anyway updated the product review rating.

------
Within 3 months I started to face issues with the monitor screen.
Displayed GREYED out.
Tried with different HDMI Cables and Laptops but definitely the screen was at fault.

The Acer support team is frustratingly Useless they will just ask you to send email and wait for email. but this email response take 3 days and that too not helpful.

Please refrain from buying acer if you do not want to face troubles in after sales."
Madhusudan Rai,Value For Money Monitor,"I didn't expect that I will get 23.8"" monitor in that price range. Tried gaming, works well for entry level gamers, i got it for 5800 with card offer, nothing to complain for the amount i paid."
Mani.K,Good Product,"True to the stated specs. Not a gamer so cannot speak about gaming experience. Only con that bothers me is the power off button needs to be long pressed to switch off the monitor. They could have made it as a simple press or given a dedicated button.Since it is at the back of the monitor one tends to forget or one needs to get up to switch off and the long press adds to the frustration in switching off the monitor.
My suggestion is to give a dedicated switch off button in the front as in Dell monitor and put the monitor controls joystick button in the back."

Shreyas,Value for Money,Been using it for more than 2 months and happy with it
,Best monitor under 7000,"I'd say it's a decent Monitor for those who wants to work and also it's good for gaming too! You can get those classic colour scheme if you are playing games like cyberpunk 2077, gta v, or like pubg! What I really liked about it is that it doesn't really hurt your eyes! As long as you'll able to get settings perfectly! Also I read most of the reviews saying that it doesn't have refresh rate of 100hz! Wrong!!!! Well! You need to do setting that way! I do have 100hz but it sometimes disables itself! I don't know what's the problem is! Though I'd prefer setting it on 75hz because that's still way smoother! Overall it's a decent Monitor! But if you want to play games at ultra settings and Max fps too then I'd suggest that you should consider increasing your budget a little and go for acer Nitro! That's the best gaming monitor you can get and it's also not that expensive! Also you can get more than 100 fps in those easily! But if you just want a simple and decent where you specifically want to do your work and some simple rendering stuff! Then this one is a great choice for you! Also I got it only in 5800 with the discount on sbi! since its a great Indian festival! So just go for it! It won't disappoint you! And have a great day! (‚Å†‚óï‚Å†·¥ó‚Å†‚óï‚Å†‚úø‚Å†)"

saikat,HDMI cable is defective in the Package.,"HDMI cable is not working which was sent in the package, I need to buy another HDMI cable to connect my laptop with the monitor. Overall good monitor for content consumption or office related work. Not recommended for gaming. Add extra money and go for Viewsonic monitor for gaming purpose."
Surjya Kant mondal,Build quality,Ok I have perched this monitor in a good price. I am fully satisfied with the panel quality but the back plastic cover is very low quality when I press the screen little bit the screen going in . That Is a negative point
Talib Qureshi,Good product,Nice performance
Amazon Customer,Nice,Good
Dolly,Dead pixel appears,Moniter good for money but dead pixel appears less than a year
,It's 100hz,
Rohit,Don't be fooled!,"This is a decent monitor, if you buy it for around ‚Çπ5,000 - ‚Çπ6,000. Anything higher, please do not consider this.
I purchased this monitor as a second display, please do not get this as your MAIN monitor.
Do not be fooled by the 100Hz, it is 100Hz but there is an ungodly amount of Ghosting, visible to the human eye. You will not like this monitor for the refresh rate or for ""gaming""
If you can manage to get the IPS version, please do so. VA panel is alright as well, the viewing angles are bad of course, which should theoretically should be better in the IPS panel. The colors are fine, not the greatest, but for this price its just fine. The contrast ratio is also bad honestly. Use it at Gamma 2.2, and use the color temperature at Normal or Custom.

If you are planning to mount it on a monitor arm, please be advised to purchase some extra screws, I didn't have the one for it's depth so I will have to purchase some, i'm using what came with my monitor arm and it sucks so, theres that. It does not come with screws for the vesa mount.
It has no Display Port, only hdmi and VGA, and no usb hub. the cable provided is very short only 1.4 meters and I had to get a longer one because it didn't reach the back of my PC.

Alternatively, buy something else, don't be fooled by the 100Hz on the page, you are better off with a 60hz monitor with no ghosting rather than 100hz with this level of ghosting."
,Best monitor in this price range,The display absolutely great due to 100% sRGB colour gamut and AMD freesync and 100hz for gaming
vad,Perfect LED computer monitor for laptop with hdmi,Perfect LED computer monitor for laptop with hdmi. Works without any issues.
,Height is more.,"Quality and display is very good but Height of the monitor is more after assembly for the table average Height of 3 feet and average height of the chair 17"". We have to purchase a new chair with height raisable to 46"" from the floor."
Rudra,Perfectly fits requirement,The best product in this price range
Deepinder Singh,Review (Gaming Test / Editing) of Acer Ek220q E3 Ips monitor.,"This is literally ips Monitor , I know there are very limited Review on this ips monitor,

Picture quality is top notch

Also it support 100hz refresh rate On (Hdmi) Graphic Card , 75hz on vga

No speaker

U can adjust only up down

Also it include sRgb mode in monitor setting
For better Color accuracy

There are minimum Ips glow In above and below corners but it only noticeable on Black background Also ips glow is normal for Ips monitor.

Pro Tips ( Gaming) There are some minimum ghosting on It so i enable display override to Normal and it really reduce the ghosting so then i try to set it on Extreme but in this case it show inverse Ghosting so i again set back the override to Normal, Also there are Vrb Mode in this monitor it completely remove the Ghosting but It Decrease Brightness.

No Black Smearing üëçüèº that is good"

,Acer EK240Y H 23.8 Inch (60.4 cm) Full HD (1920x1080) VA Panel LCD Monitor with LED Back Light,"PROS:-
1) Monitor is good in terms of size at this price point
2) Display quality is awesome at this price
3) Support both VGA & HDMI display output

CONS:-
1) The 100Hz Refresh Rate is totally a gimmick as at 1080p resolution I didn't get the option to set the refresh rate to 100Hz
2) If u set the refresh rate to 75 Hz it will reduce the screen size horizontally by approx 3-4%

One more thing it might be PROS for some people & CONS for some other that is VGA Cable is missing instead there is HDMI Cable

OVERALL THE MONITOR IS QUITE AWESOME AT THIS PRICE & INFACT IT'S THE LARGEST SCREEN SIZE MONITOR AT THIS PRICE i.e. ‚Çπ6666"
