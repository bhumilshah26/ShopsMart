Deepak Chawla,Best of all Tablets in the market if you can afford it,"Pros.
1. This is the high-end tablet in the market which is suitable for all your needs.
2. When combined with Magic Keyboard and Pencil, you can use it as a minicomputer and not to say, the apple magic keyboard has no competitor.
3. New feature of pencil hovering is awesome.
4. No lags, display is awesome.
5. Battery backup is great if you are using wifi model or only wifi most of the times.
6. In case using cellular data, it is less than wifi model but still you can use it for 2-3 whole days if you are a high end user. In my case, I am able to use it for 4-5 whole days on one full charge on LTE.
7. Application support is great and best when compared to other brand top model as well.

Cons:
1. Price is a negative point, if you can afford it buy it. It is worth every penny spent.
2. Display should be similar as provided in 12.9 Inch, that would be great.

Note: this is the best tablet in the market considering the battery backup, applications support etc."
Shanmugavadivel,Genuine product,Genuine product with Apple warranty and original packing üëç. Received in time also.
Chowdri,Performance,"Performance is good, but not meet the expectations like they advertising. Amazon packing is worst, product cover been damaged."
Satya S Roddam,Worth it,Good product. Great for photo editing. A bit slow for video editing.
Rajat,Overkill! Superb Performance,"I have been using this for editing my GoPro 4k footages and this device has been a beast!! No hiccups whatsoever and amazing screen quality. Lightroom and DaVinci Resolve works seamlessly and promotion is also very good. I expected battery life to be a bit better but standby time is great, so no complains overall."
SACHIN YADAV,SOMEHOW DISAPPOINTED BUT HAPPY ALSO,"JUST AFTER RECEIVING THE IPAD , I OPENED THE BOX EVERYTHING LOOKS AWESOME AS ALWAYS APPLE PREMIUM UNBOXING üòÇ.
I POWER ON THE IPAD AND BOOM üí• THE IPAD SCREEN GOT FROZE ü´§.
I IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE APPLE SUPPORT THEY HELPED ME A LOT AND I APPRECIATE APPLE SUPPORT THEY ARE LIKE INCREDIBLE TO HELP YOU,THEIR TALKING BEHAVIOUR, PATIENCE I LOVED IT .
AFTER TAKING HELP FROM APPLE SUPPORT I UPDATED IPAD STILL SCREEN WAS FROZEN.
SUPPORT SAID PLEASE VISIT NEAREST SERVICE CENTRE
AT SERVICE CENTER AS ALWAYS CALM AND LOVELY BEHAVIOUR SUPPORT üòá HELPED ME
THEY REPLACED MY IPAD AND GIT IT BACK AFTER A WEEK.
SO, HOW IS IPAD
DON'T DOUGHT ON APPLE'S IPS OR LIQUID RETUNA DISPLAY IT IS ALMOST AMOLED ONLY AS IT PROVIDES RICH COLOUR, CONTRAST AND BLACKS .
PERFORMANCE - APPLE BE LIKE TO ANDROID
BETA TUMSE NA HO PAYEGA BECAUSE IT HAS M2 APPLE SILICON WHICH ONLY SPEEDY BRAINS CAN HANDLE .
BATTERY BACKUP - 7 HOURS FREE FIRE AT MAX SETTINGS.
SMOOTHNESS AND IPAD OS IS JUST CHUMESWARI üòò
SPECIALLY FOR GAMERS THE CONSISTENCY AFTER CONTINUOUS LONG SESSIONS.
CAMERA - EQUIVALENT TO IPHONE 13
CHARGING - AS ALWAYS WORLD'S FASTEST CHARGING 20W üòÇ , BUT I LOVED AS IT TAKE MORE 60 min to charge 50% which helps user to take a rest, apple care for our health and ipad health also üòá."
,Brand itself defines,You will love it
Well wisher,Original product but the packaging was dirty,"When package arrived I opened package in front of delivery agent. The box was dirty and had fort marks on it. I asked him I am scared of the Product is original. He asked me to raise a concern if product is damaged. I opened the box checked everything inside and the model number, relieved to know it's an original apple product. This is my first ipad so can't comment on technical aspects until I use it but look and feel is really good. Excited to put it to good use."
shubhangi more,Maintaining an apple product is expensive,"Ipad doesn't support WhatsApp app. It's also not support many pro app for editing, which imac allow."
VINEET MISHRA,Except display quality for price Everything is brilliant,"I have stopped using my laptop. This has become my primary device. I do competitive programming and watch Ott for hours. It Looks very sexy, Battery is good but could have been better. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS, that I have iphone 13 which has oled display, which lacks LTPO but I feel has better display. I have used samsung smartphone in past and have seen Samsung S series tablet, both of which had Super Amoled, they lacked LTPO but have had far superior display with constant 120 Hz. This is just a simple LED panel, which kind of makes me very SAD because of the amount I paid. Together with magic keyboard, it cost me more around 1.09 Lakh. With that being said, it has LED display, feels like I only paid for apple logo. So, I would advise people, if you can find go for m1 version pro or Air(which is better for 90% people out there), there is literally no difference in m1 and m2 in day to day usage. AND My advise to Apple, if they ever read this, if u are so much into charging for every single feature you offer, better, take away all the faltu gimmick like LTPO or even 120 Hz from display & please offer genuine features like OLED or at least mini-LED(but mini-LED will drain more power) with better battery in ipad pro 11‚Äù, i don‚Äôt want to buy 12.9 for mni-Led, because people buy tablets for portablity, 11‚Äô‚Äô inch is the right sweet spot size of pro tablets, just load it with every best feature for a tablet you got in your inventory, or soon you will loose the brand value you have earned over the years among your customers."

SAHIL J,BEAST FOR DAILY UASGE,"JUST GOT IT TODAY AND PRETTY HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE . THOUGHT KI IT WILL BE SUCH SMALL SCREEN AS PREVIOUSLY USING 12.9 , BUT ITS EXTREMELY HANDY AND GOOD FOR STUDENT LIKE ME WHO TAKES BASIC NOTES AND JUST VIDEO SURFING BUT STILL IF YOU HAVE THAT EXTRA 30K ILL SUGGEST YOU TO BUY 12.9"
Umakanta,The product is genuine and good.,The product is genuine and was in good condition.But it's box was a bit damaged.Better packaging is necessary for such costly items.
,iPad is great. But have you tried not using it?,"Well! I bought the iPad and woah ü§Ø I was amazed at both the features of the device and my capability to waste unnecessary money on fancy devices.
The device has added a lot of value in my life , now I can sit in Starbucks and pretend to be a big shot. In approx one and a half lakh I have won the opportunity to look like a rich man and have lost the window to purchase Apple stocks that maybe can make me a little bit rich. But who cares as far as I Look rich, I am rich."
Hitesh J.,Great performance,"I bought it on June 2023 and its just great and the performance is amazing.
I mostly used this for my website updates, thats daily and for making short videos"
Jack Jared,Always like,Always like
Abby,Not worth 90k but pretty good,"It's a good ipad but just underwhelming when you look at other products sold by Apple that are much cheaper like ipad air or something , instead of going all in and buying a 1 lakh tablet you could just buy a 50-60k ipad air and use the remaining money for the new iPhone. Think smart , not hard"
Daksh Bhardwaj,Best tablet,I love this as my daily laptop. A good alternative to not just a laptop but also amazon kindle oasis. i mean if you can buy an ipad for as low as 40000 then whats point of spending 28000 on a device which just read books
,Pen sath me nhi diya or na hi keyboard,
Ashish Katariya,Worth the money,Very good fast with M2 chip stable and very useful device
Rani,Nice,Good product.
Biswajyoti Deb,Happy with it,Good product as expected and light weight to carry
Placeholder,"Buy the 12.1 Inch M2 iPad XDR PRO Display only, not it's small Brother.","That's why it's said since Centuries "" Speech is Silvern;! Silence is Golden"". I had no business in the first place to any Feedback whatsoever. Bitter Truth always hurts. Even you know this, so do I and so does the whole world. My Review contained Inappropriate Comments. I had primarily asked for a Refund so I could upgrade to the 12.1 Inch M2 iPad XDR PRO with XDR DISPLAY. At around 4 am that day, One of your very own Customer Care Executives who are Multi-faced and Multi-faceted, told me to wait 3 days for a decision on the Refund. I later discovered he had deliberately fooled me into raising my hopes for the Refund and then dashing them to the ground--tantalizing me, in other words. Perhaps, he didn't have the Courage to be Frank Enough and dismiss me abruptly as your other Customer Care Executive Smita did. Your Agreement with Apple should have been highlighted in the first place. But it was deliberately and carefully hidden. It surfaced only after Smita told me straight that your Tie-up with Apple rules out a Refund. Fine! No Problem! "" False, Misleading, Inauthentic Comments or Profane and Misleading "" is your Style of Business and Functioning.Not mine. I had been denied a Refund and immediately asked for Feedback.It was like rubbing salt in my wounds. I May not be as Qualified and Capable as you are to do Business, but I can understand that if I had even the slightest hint that I wouldn't get a Refund at all, I would never have wasted my Time and Energy in giving you a Feedback or writing a Review. I don't know how you would have reacted if Customer Care Executives from the same Company tantalized you and then dismissed you like a Beggar under the pretext of Privacy Policy and some Unknown and Hidden Agreement of yours with Big Boss Apple!"
Aniket Roy,Just bought the ipad pro 11inch model base variant,"Got a new product in perfect condition. Although the box was a little scratched and didn‚Äôt had a plastic wrap made me a little suspicious about the product i received but it was fine on inspection no problem with the device.
