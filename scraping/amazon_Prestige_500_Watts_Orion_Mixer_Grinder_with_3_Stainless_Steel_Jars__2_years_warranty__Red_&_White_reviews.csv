Radhika G,"Stylish, sturdy and budget friendly powerful mixer grinder","Play Video
I purchased Prestige Orion after months of research for my mom who was tired of using old mixer grinder. The previous one has several issues such as lid fitting, low capacity and performance. Also, the plastic was not good. But this Prestige Orion has sturdy built and high performance. Also, the lids fit properly.

The product came fully packed and was delivered on time. Nothing is broken and manual is provided. The product has 3 jars, largest one for blending, second for dry grinding and smallest is chutney jar.

All three are fully-functional and whipping option is provided for milk-shake lovers.

I would highly recommend this product because of cost-effectivity and high performance as well as build quality."
The Savvy Shopper,Good wedding gift item,"Received a review from the family we gifted this. The Prestige Orion Mixer Grinder is a reliable kitchen appliance for everyday use. With its 500-watt motor, it is capable of handling various grinding and blending tasks efficiently. The inclusion of stainless steel jars ensures durability and easy maintenance. However, potential buyers may want to consider factors like the grinder's noise level, ease of cleaning, and the performance of the blades."
Gaurav,Quality,Its been a month i am using it now its just amazing the quality is awesome
shashi bora,Lesson why not to buy such appliances online!,"Worked well but only for 1 year or so , bought it in aug 2022 and it broke down in oct 2023. Now I am not sure how to feel ,is this much return enough? as it costed around 2000 . When took it to a mechanic he said its built quality is really poor motor carbon or armitage is damaged and may cost any where 250/ to 500/ to repair. It is still in warrenty period but going to a service center which is nearly 20 km will cost nearly 300 so ( for two trips) so decided to give it to a near by mechanic. So warrenty is not worth cribbing over, so there it is, my 2 cents!
Last brand of mixi lasted nearly 15 years and costed some where 1200 rs. These days some times I think money is just like an un reliable pet dog . U just have to wait to get robbed to find its usefulness!"

tushar,Good,Box was broken
Bharat,Good quality,Very useful items
Rinika,Outer packaging damaged,Packaging was damaged.. looks like someone did it intentionally to look inside the box. The grinder is good and works properly but I don't know that if I was supposed to get warranty card or not . Because there weren't any warranty card. Three prestige mixer grinder is really good with 3 mixer grinder jars and works perfectly. Although it makes a little sound it's noisy a bit.. but I guess that's ok for mixer grinder to have a sound. So no issues with the grinder.Just the outer package had a hole.. so I do request Amazon to kindly not to send damaged package for further orders.

Fayes,Prestige!,It's working fine so far.Not a silent motor. But keep in mind of the service that prestige offers!. If it does not give repair work for 24 months than money recovered. The jars are of good quality so no issues.
DEEPAK KUMAR,good product,better this price
Muthulakshmi,Performance,Less noisy operation. Valuable product from prestige.

Amrita P.,Good purchase but watch out for the handles coming loose in no time.,Blends fast. Sharp blades. Lids sit well. Container sizes are fine with me. One issue is with the handles for the two big jars -- became loose within a month and one just came off in 2 months' time. So do check the product for this on delivery.
M Anjaneyulu,Not good,Faulty item received
Abinaya,The medium size jar blade was lose I believe,The medium size jar made sound so returned
SANJAY NERETTY,Not working machine,"I have purchased the Prestige Orion Mixer Grinder machine but suddenly not working at the moment. This is machine purchased against serial no JD0923084678 under warranty period.

Kindly look into the same at earliest.

Thanks and Regards
