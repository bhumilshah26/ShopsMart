abhijeet,Worst Amazon Experience for thr premium product,"Worst product and delivery experience.
Keyboard keys are loose and making mechanical sound sound which are irritating.
Item packaging was not proper, they just put the package in a larger amazon box. They should pack the premium items properly."
Amazon Customer,Slower and Expensive,Took a bad decision of buying this should have rather gotten the M1 macbook air than this slower NAND chip and just M2 chip and different body is not worth the money really

,Love the machine. Hate the trackpad,"The Macbook air M2 has all positives. Have been using the MacBook Air 2015 till now. This MacBook is smooth there is no lag works amazing. The new age websites no longer ignore Safari or MacBooks like they used to in the past.

My only gripe is the size of the trackpad. Having used to using a decent size trackpad on the previous MacBook, I personally feel it is huge and most the time one of my finger (either the Pinky or Ring finger) is always on the trackpad when i rest my wrist on the laptop.

I have started to use a mouse, but a lot of features that I am used to are more comfortable by using it on the trackpad.

On the positive note, there are loads of videos on YouTube to optimise your usage of the MacBook and they are really helpful in exploring the potential of this beauty"
Minaz S.,The best deal of the day,"Mac Book air is one of the most value for money investment. Excellent display, responsive touch pad and the ease of IOS gives a one up from any laptops."
Susmit Chandra,Ossm,
Nihar R.,Worth buying,"Got the perfect MacBook that a student can buy , works even better than M1 Air , and personally so called slower SSD is not an issue so don't worry about it."
,Very powerful laptop,The base model is enough for the collage students and for coding. But for the Editor's need to buy 16core 512GB Model.
Amazon Customer,Worried to buy from amaon,Reading the review and support from Amazon discouraged to buy from Amazon. Very risky proposition. Better to buy from stores as this are expensive products.
Books are my savior (BAMS),Repeated Logic Board Failures in M2 and M1 MacBooks,"My MacBookAir suddenly died one fine day, conveniently after the manufacturer’s warranty expired. I had bought the 2020 model in 2021 and it suddenly stopped powering on in 2023. I took it to Apple Genius bar and they ran some tests and said well the whole Logic Board has failed and has to be replaced at my own cost ( which is a whopping half the cost I paid for the whole laptop!). A brand new windows laptop can be bought in the amount they quoted for the Logic Board replacement! I was shocked as there was absolutely no internal or external damage, I have never even taken my MacBookAir out of the house, I have always used it carefully and with obviously only used the original MacBookAir charger that came with it, so WHY should the Logic Board suddenly die one day suddenly? And the Geniuses at Apple replied, “Oh well, it happens sometimes”.

I was disappointed by their callous response- and decided to do some research online - I was shocked to learn that it is not happening “sometimes”, the new 2019 onwards Macbook Airs, specially with the M1 (and even M2) processors are rampantly having a Logic Board failure within 2 years of buying or/and having faulty screen display problems. Plus there were other issues- many which do not have logic board failures, were having huge overheating problems. Just search this Apple Support Discussion Page as one example where scores of angry customers have narrated how their Logic Board (which is the main component, the “mother board” of the laptop) has completely failed anywhere from within 1 month to 2 years of buying the MacBook. And this is happening to both MacBookAir and MacBookPro. Faults with both the M2 and M1 processors.

These problems were SO common that it is very clear that- it is not just “sometimes” that the new MacBooks are failing. The common thread was: Logic Board failure, all models customers mentioned were fairly recently bought, 2019 onwards, and all the problems manifested within 2 years of buying. This is a failure of huge proportions that warrants a recall of the 2020-onwards models as we loyal customers of Apples are being fooled into paying the mighty price of replacing the Logic Board again and again! And shockingly, for many users, even after paying for replacing the logic board, the Logic board fails again! Which means there is absolutely NO guarantee - even after paying huge amount $$$ to replace the Logic Board, it can fail again after the mere 3-month warranty that Apple gives after replacing the logic board.

Not sure if Apple is purposely floating cheap quality products to those who refuse to buy AppleCare as they are really pushing customers to buy AppleCare these days. And even if one buys Apple Care for 2 or 3 years, the logic board can fail even a day after the 2 yr warranty expires . Is Apple putting refurbished Logic Boards as replacement, especially in third-world countries? Just what explains such horrible performance of new MacBooks then?? I am surprised by this phenomenon.

I, just like mang others, was slapped with a huge bill of 50% the price of my nearly new, lightly used MacBookAir - just because I was given a faulty piece by Apple! And yet , even the replaced Logic Board has failed again for many! My previous MacBooks (bought in early and mid 2000’s have lasted 7+ years with no issues what so ever). But the 2020 onward MacBooks are an appalling failure!

This is just not acceptable - we buy Macs because traditionally Macs have had the reputation that ‘Macs are built to last’ - and that is the reason we don’t mind paying *more than double* the amount for a Mac as a compared to a windows laptop. But with so many MacBooks failing within 2 years of buying, this reputation is quickly eroding, as the new MacBook hardware is only as sturdy as any cheap generic brand windows laptop which cost less than half. I am feeling cheated.

My trust in my once-favorite brand, Apple, is sadly lost, and I honestly can’t find a good reason for me to recommend anyone to pay so much to buy a MacBook again. I urge all to write to @Tim_Cook and @AppleSupport on Twitter as you may think you are the only one with this Logic Board failure - but this is a rampant problem, which must be brought to the attention on Twitter, or else no one will ever know. Please don’t forget to use appropriate hashtags such as #MacBookAir #MacBookM1 #FaultyMacBookLogicBoard etc. Please also tweet this to @AppleTrack @AppleNews @MacbookAirBuzz and any other prominent Apple-related handle."
