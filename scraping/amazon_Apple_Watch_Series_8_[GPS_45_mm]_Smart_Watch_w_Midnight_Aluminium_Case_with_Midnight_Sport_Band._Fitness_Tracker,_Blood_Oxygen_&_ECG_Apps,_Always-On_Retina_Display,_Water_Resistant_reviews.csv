Arvind Rawat,"Great but, found it at a decent price","Mainly using this as a health tracker and a way to minimise the interaction with phone. It suits the needs for most cases.
Have a very good integration with few apps like Amazon music, while rest of them are not that great like Google maps ( although it works ).
Will recommend a smart band for a better battery life over this, if features or eco-system is not a priority."
Debdeep G.,Best and no frills smartwatch,"Earlier I had ordered the same cellular watch 45mm from F*kart (since it was as low as 42k on sale), but I got a fake watch during the delivery. I made a post on Reddit with the entire delivery video and how I saved myself with the open-box delivery. People there recommended that I buy the product from the Apple store itself or Amazon. But since I don't have any such store nearby, I thought of giving Amazon a try.

The best thing that happened afterward was that when the product was about to deliver, I was reluctant to receive the delivery without the delivery guy opening the package right in front of me. He calmed me down saying I can easily open it at any time later and just make a recording while doing it. This was the best part of the delivery that I liked.

I opened the watch, but it was completely discharged. There was a snake screen, which wasn't going away at the press of any buttons. Searched it online and found out that it was a common watch discharge issue with multiple users. The solution was to keep the watch on charging mode for at least 15-20 mins and then it would boot it up itself, which happened for me eventually.

To perform another level of delivery safety check, I used the watch serial no. and checked its status on the Apple check coverage status website. It was a completely new one.

One unknown disappointment I faced was getting e-sim support from the Indian carriers. Most of them don't support the cellular service on Apple Watches unless you buy a postpaid plan from them, which feels completely gimmicky at this point in 2023.

I would recommend buying Apple products from Amazon, no matter how discounted they are on other websites. Apple clones (macs to chargers) are freely available in the market."
,Apple Watch series 8 45mm GPS+Cellular,"The watch is superb in terms of looks and feel. The watch band itself is so comfortable and it doesn’t give irritation even after wearing for long hours or all day.

Pros:
1) The accuracy of sensors are top notch and they work smoothly.
2) The connectivity and usability of this watch and phone is phenomenal. Initially it would take time to setup and pair and once done you’ll can literally forget your phone for each and every notification.
3) The calling functionality is superb as well and the voice is crisp and clear as if you are talking through your mobile.
4) The watch faces are simply amazing and you can customize watches according to your usability.
5) The touch accuracy is top notch too. You can easily access notifications, reply to normal text, WhatsApp chats, answer or decline calls.

Cons:
The only con I have observed is the battery life. I would say battery life is decent but not that great. It would last around a day just like your iPhone.

The price tag in India for Apple Watch is too much costly.

I would recommend to go for this product if you have an iPhone and if the price of the watch is below 50k."
abhi,"Good product, obviously overpriced and poor battery backup.","I've used Galaxy Gear3 Frontier since 2018, so my experience is more of coming from a different ecosystem to Apple. Here is what I've observed.

The Good:
1. Seamless integration and response with iPhone and the app ecosystem
2. Better accuracy for sensors as compared to other counterparts. (But only in the range of 3% to 5%)
3. Efficient User Experience and navigation
4. Charges pretty quickly if you have a fast charger from Apple
5. Not a design fan at first, but it has started to grow on me, so I guess its better
6. Watch face complications for apps is a great addition and provides a better-personalized experience

The Bad:
1. Screen design gets scratched really easily on the curved edges
2. For larger wrist sizes, even the 48mm version looks like a little odd-ball. The size look out of place or maybe a bit too tiny. I have medium-large wrists, if I put on additional weight or start going to gym to buff-up, won't look as good.
3. The crown dial looks promising but it still not the best way to operate the app. Comparing to the screen dial navigation on Galaxy Wear 3, the crown dial is not even remotely close. Galaxy Wear 3's dial rotation works better and in a more natural manner.

The worst:
1. Battery backup is pathetic at best. 15 hours max with all the sensors and features on, 24 hours only after you keep the Battery Saving Mode on.
2. Lack of watch faces without downloading separate apps is a huge downside for me personally. You have limited watch faces with the default Watch App. For additional watch faces you are required to download additional apps and customize them which is usually paid on subscription basis."
,Works like Charm,Arrived same-day and works flawlessly! My dad is smitten. Contemplating getting one for myself as well.
Ayush C.,Amazing watch if you have the budget must go for this,The watch is really nice and if you have the iPhone MacBook and iPad it’s really mix well with the Apple ecosystem. Apple Watch has really nice apps and the readings are accurate. The one thing that I like into the Apple Watch is the user interface and the way it worked to smoothness is really amazing. The battery is one day but I don’t see any challenge on that because if you are going for bathing or some other task you can charge half or one hour and it will last again one day for you. Comparing the feature it has it required the power must go for it.
Divyang Oza,Great Purchase.,My wrist is small so opted for 41mm. I got it for 28499 during g the sale and it is definitely a fantastic purchase. The features are awesome. Battery life is 1 and half days with essential notifications on.
Nitesh Thakur,Enthusiast product,"It’s a great watch and offers a lot of good features. The watch integrates really well with the Apple ecosystem. Not getting a cellular variant can be worth it if you use your phone around the watch, the call handoff is pretty smooth.
In terms of tracking and fitness, theres a wide variety of options and it would be hard to try and use all of them. The standout feature personally for me would be the aesthetics and the ability to customise and use as many watch faces as possible.
The battery life is decent at best. You can get two days of battery life at lower power mode and with Always On switched off. It goes down to about 30% if you have Always On turned on.
It’s a good purchase if you can find a good deal around it."
,Best product from Apple,"The Apple Watch Series 8 is the latest iteration of the popular smartwatch that offers a range of features for health, fitness, communication and entertainment. The watch has a sleek design, a bright and responsive display, and a variety of sensors and apps that can monitor your heart rate, blood oxygen, sleep quality, activity levels and more. The watch also supports wireless charging, cellular connectivity, Siri voice assistant, Apple Pay and other useful functions.

However, the watch is not without its drawbacks. One of the main issues is the battery life, which is not very impressive compared to some of the competitors. The watch can last for about 18 hours on a single charge, which means you have to charge it every night or carry a charger with you during the day. This can be inconvenient if you want to use the watch for longer periods of time or track your sleep patterns. The battery life can also vary depending on how you use the watch and what settings you choose.

The watch is compatible only with iPhones, so if you have an Android phone or another device, you will not be able to use it.

Overall, the Apple Watch Series 8 is a great device for Apple fans and users who want a versatile and advanced smartwatch that can do many things. The battery life and the price are two of the main factors that you should consider before buying this watch."
Vigneshwar M,Don’t be afraid of the red!,"I bought it during a sale. Got partially opened main box though! I guess the seller replaced the original combo which probably had a more expensive strap and replaced it with original fluroesastomer red strap. I am assuming that there was no stock of the original combo for mind peace sake. Seals of individual boxes were not open. Now about the watch, I didn’t like the original strap colour though, it’s a more of a dark pink/ peach colour rather than red, so I replaced it with a leather red&black strap. The watch itself is very good and everything works fluidly. I have used noise watches before and this is a very very premium experience and incomparable to any other watches. The only bad thing is that glass is prone to a lot of scratches very easily. If you put a screen protector the touch sensitivity reduces drastically and make it feel like a low quality watch. AOD is very very helpful but I have kept the spO2 monitor off and I get about 1.5 days of real life battery. ECG is over hyped and so is spO2. People looking for a much strong scratch proof watch should go for the ultra or the stainless steel variant, but at this price I think apple ought to have given sapphire glass. Again this is apple trying to push more premium watches. Bottom line, if you need AOD buy series 8, if not, go for SE. If you need scratch prof tough watch, go for ultra. I think stainless steel isn’t worth it unless you get it below 50K. Overall I am happy with the purchase."
Bharat Acharya Education,Go for the ultra instead,Yes this is great. No doubt. But the ultra is better
vishwa,For good price I brought this from great Indian festival offer,"Touch is smooth
Idle battery drain 6 to 7%
Good functionality
No issues with touch etc"
Kindle Customer,Not worth the price,"I was using watch series 3 since 2018. I thought to upgrade it. But I got bit disappointed. Below are some of my observations:

1. I had 42 mm watch series 3 , and I bought the 41 mm series 8. Surprisingly, this 1 mm change is quite noticeable and makes watch looks quite small in your hand. While 45 mm was too big for my wrist. So 41mm size didn’t go well with me.

2. I thought it will have many new feature as it is GPS+ cellular. However, there are hardly few apps where you can use it. Anyway, you can call from your watch when you will not have mobile. It solves the purpose. You can play apple music too from watch. It will play on a Bluetooth connected device.

3. If you are a apple watch user since last 5-6 year, and have 42 mm watch earlier, I would say don’t go with 41 mm at all. It’s been 5 days, I am still not comfortable with it’s small size.

4. Check the price in your nearby apple store before purchasing from amazon. After buying it from Amazon, I got to know that in my nearby authorised dealer, the price which i was paying for 41 mm, 45 mm is available.

5. Delivery and order placing experience was worst. It showed me next day delivery, but the moment i did the payment, it changed the date to 6 days after the purchase. On the delivery day also, order delivered at 7:45 pm.

6. Heart beat and blood o2 level apps are there. Hope it will work when needed but the data it is collecting not much reliable.

Overall, if you really want to purchase it, go for it. But don’t upgrade it until you must want to do it. Rest, its your money. Do whatever you want to do.🙂"
sandeepbhajan,Worlds best Smart Watch,"I have iPhone 14, iPad 7gen and now Apple Watch series 8, 45mm. The watch is very good by look and by gesture controls it’s is smooth by function yes it’s expensive but it’s battery life is not that good Apple should do something about it over all it’s a good watch I give 4 star one star less for battery life"
,Best Digital Watch I ever Used,"The watch gives a nice feel.
Premium looks, battery is very good if kept on low power mode.
Can attend calls and send messages directly from watch..no need to rely on fone...
Good Heart rate results, Steps tracking, etc"
Jitendra Rawat,Choose your size correctly,"Delivered on time & securely by Amazon. Apple delivers a promise, watch is great. Watch notifications really helps it has reduced my mobile screen time.
As far as size goes choose 41mm if your wrist size is 160mm or less. It fits comfortable, feels light on wrist & does not look bulky."
keval,The product need care as it’s not cheap.,"I have seen people complaining about bad/defective items received. So, I was a bit sceptical about ordering this watch. However, I received an absolutely good product and that too two days prior to the delivery schedule. I have already used Apple Watch SE (GPS + Cellular) and my experience with iwatch is good. However I needed to upgrade, so I ordered this watch Apple Watch Series 8 (GPS + Cellular), and I really love the always ON display and ECG function.

I would suggest iPhone users to use Apple Watch if anyone wants to buy a smartwatch as other watches do not have seamless connectivity with iPhones (I tried galaxy watch 5, it works well but ain’t great as I have an apple ecosystem)."
Tapiyar,Comfort,Outstanding Product by Apple
,Ok type,Ok type not so good
Rajesh Bhati,Awesome,Go for it
DONT BUY THIS LIGHT I RECIVED THIS LIGHT ITS NOT WORKING AFTER CHARGING ALSO THIS BUYER IS ABCHEATER,Good product real watch,Very genuine seller must buy from him
Kapil Tiwari,overall okay but battery backup,battery backup is just like apple things rest all functions and health monitoring is great.
,Wowww,"What a greate product. Absolutely amazing. True to its name and quality.
Buy from Amazon without any second thoughts. Amazon is trustworthy unlike FK."
Susheel Sharma,Near to accurate readings.,"I wanted a watch with most possible accuracy although i own a samsung watch too but this apple eco system didn’t let me sync the watch to an iphone. So yes the watch works perfectly fine, fits good, for me battery backup is decent too. What else. Its just a perfect watch."
Bhuwnesh Sharma,Great product,"I`m happy with them. Now I can monitor my activity, sports, heart beat and can see the messages coming and calls, no need to have the phone always near by and what is most important to pick up the phone every time when somebody is calling or writing. Very happy with that. Size as well is good for my hand, everything is visible. I bought many different strips and they all suit my outfit."
,Great product,Great features and utility. Battery backup during lte is poor
Pavani Jain,Product red watch looks stunning,"Bought First apple watch
The watch for apple users having iphone and know what apple want to deliver the end user experience. It’s just great and amazing user experience."
,Premium Quality & excellent reliability with comparatively higher price !!!,"Pros:
*Premium Quality
*Excellent reliability
*Provides confidence
*Provides privilege

Cons:
*Comparatively very higher price
*Poor battery back up. Last max upto 24hrs.
*In our busy 24*7 days, we will missed out charging a watch in most days. Hence, wearing as a showcase in many days rather than purpose of a watch.

Recommend: We the customers can reduce the price of this watch by purchasing better quality watch of other brands with lower price.Once demand decreases, price will constantly fall."
shibin jose,Awesome,"Apple is always best, no comments and good product"
Krunal Patel,"Apply watch series 8, 41 mm",Its a genuine apple watch. I bought the 41mm starlight variant and its perfect for my wrist. If you are confused between the 41mm and 45mm variant I would say for girls 41mm fits better on the wrist. The 45mm looks too big. The battery stays for 2days.
RAJEEV KUMAR,Nice,Everything as per expectations
U R Chowdhury,Sleep tracking needs to improve - simply put its worse,All other features work as expected from Apple but Sleep tracking is like at least decade back. A ₹ 5000 watch has better Sleep Tracking than compared to this Apple.
MR,⭐️got this watch @26k💰💸💲,Dont spend more than 26k for this. Above this will be a bad deal.
,Just go for SE instead,"The only differences from SE are the ecg and oxymeter; and Apple do not claim them to be accurate. You may not use it after two days when the vanity wanes. Better priced is the SE Cellular for 36K.
The size of 45mm is not different from 44 mm SE. You also pay more for apple care+, which is essential as the glass is fragile.
Both iWatch 8 and SE can be used for swimming in the pool, measuring exercises, so save 12 K and go for SE."
Dev.P,apple watch eight,"Goes without saying, this is one of the best gadgets to have on your person. Always on display makes it an absolute charm to check time. I use this watch for my gym workouts too. Battery life is satisfactory. I charge this watch while driving to office. that keeps it going for the full day of usage. You can use any photo as watchface.
Apple watch has a nice road-presence too. People notice it. It is a recommended buy."
amar,Excellent deal,Deal was excellent so i replaced my existing but delivery was delayed.
Sibayan Das,Super,"Liked the ease of operation, notification facility, fitness tracking, etc. Still exploring. Working fine. Battery lasts one day with normal activities. Liked it."
SANTOSH V.,Got this for 29k during prime days sale,Upgraded from Series 4 and it’s worth it. People with generation 6 or above should wait for next generation.
Amazon Customer,Greatest health watch ever,All trackers are amazingly synced together and health data is too awesome. Best watch for people who seek to know
Nadeem sheikh,Premium I Watch,"Easy cellular setup with Jio network and 24 hrs battery backup. Feel and experience is of a premium product. Cost me around 54,800 with SBI card discount. Quick setup and takes around 2hrs to fully recharge with 20 watt charger. Awesome integration along multiple apple products.

Major drawback:
1. Only limited apps availability. No WhatsApp, you can only respond via I watch
2. Bug in Amazon prime music app. Manually select the next song(it’s a known bug)
3. Need to have Apple Music subscription to encash the full advantage of cellular capability."
Abhirup Gorai,It's Apple,Obviously if u r in the Apple ecosystem then it's the best smartwatch for you else you can't use it with any androids.
Bhavesh Raj Singh,Great watch ! Must buy.,"Although a bit expansive but honestly I loved this watch. This is my first time using an iWatch and honestly I loved this product. However I encountered a problem and that was while I was setting up my watch. I bought a GPS plus Cellular version and sadly my carrier (Airtel) does not supports the setup. For now I have left it as it is and have applied for the carrier porting to Jio. The watch works perfectly with it. Other than that the product deserves a 5 on 5. Great build quality, looks expansive and does the job for you quite conveniently. The product was delivered timely without any defect."
,great,Great buy
Pujesh,Genuine apple watch 45 mm series 8,I was skeptical at first if i would get a genuine new product. But i checked the serial number as well as the whole build and other compatibility with iphone 14. It is a genuine and valid original piece provided. Happy with it
abhishek bhattacharjee,"Apple, name is enough..!",My first ever Apple Watch. Have been using iPhones and other Apple accessories since 2017 but was sceptical about Apple Watch for which I used Huawei GT2 for more than 2 years. After lots n lots of research finally canceled the plan of buying an Ultra (too costly just for the sake of brand love) and bought series 8 45mm. Loving every bit of it. No doubt Apple ecosystem is one of the best when it comes to customer experience. Only point that could be mentioned is battery life. I hope Apple works on it.
,You will get everything as Apple promised except the battery life,"I bought a 41mm GPS, I have been using it for over two weeks now. It has all the amazing features, I started tracking my sleep cycle and adjusting my bedtimes. Fitness, Heart rate, and Blood oxygen level are really helpful to monitor before and after a workout. But I have to charge it for around 14 - 16 hours of usage. I am using a Mac charger since it supports fast charging."
Dhiraj,Amazing,It feels amazing to have a mini phone all the time with you.
Saravanakumar,It’s Apple Watch new packed and best price for that day,Original packaging fast delivery and on the day of purchase it was as the cheapest supplier
,Call hearing sound in the watch is very low.,"When I make a call or receive a call on Apple Watch 8, call hearing sound is very low."
Lokesh Lasod,Best smartwatch,Great features and accuracy but value for money only if you have iPhone.
