Priceless,Decently featured laptop,"This laptop is newly launched in Q4 2021 and has all the features that can enable one to work for business/ office as well as entertainment purposes.

I did a lot of research before buying this laptop for my purposes and would like to share the same with you to make your decision easier.

The key features because of which I bought the laptop are:
1. Latest Windows 11 Software
2. 512 MB SSD / 8 GB RAM
3. 15.6 inch FHD screen (would have been better with IPS display, but I was ok to compromise on this in favor of other features)
4. Lifetime free Microsoft Office (no need to purchase separately)
5. Backlit keyboard
6. Tactile and smooth keys with very little travel and less sound
7. Loud and Good Dolby Speakers, easy on the ears
8. Good battery life (one charge can last upto 6-7 hours with medium usage of speakers and display brightness)
9. AMD Ryzen 5 5500 : Very nifty and quick processor. The boot time is approx 3 secs, which is fast.

This piece is good for office, music, movies and basic data analysis and games.

Would definitely recommend to buy this laptop as it is value for money"
,Good product,Processor and handling everything good.But display only not good
MUTHUSELVAN. J,Simply Superb! One of the Best Laptop for 40k,"It's been 2 months now just wanna say it's mind blowing only disappointed with the Screen which is slight dull as it is anti glare. Rest all fine. Good for students,WFH jobs for housewives,retired ppl, children's, students. No lag while playing Games, pre installed MS available.Great performance. Upgradable RAM
As far battery power is upto 6-7 hrs .
When playing normal games 4-5 hours max.Sleek & Light weight laptop.
Comfortable Keyboard.
Great performance
Average Webcam

Cons: Dull display.

I would suggest those who are looking under 45k to buy this Laptop.
I got it for 30k with exchange.
Overall decent but go for it"
Pons. Muckatira,Good laptop.,"i.) I don't know why people are cribbing so much about the screen. The laptops which have an IPS display with a similar configuration (and 15.6"" screens) are mostly over Rs. 55000. You get what you pay for. If needing an IPS display because you're too lazy to occasionally adjust the screen is worth Rs.10000 more, be my guest. The screen and display are absolutely fine otherwise (yes, you can watch movies and everything else).

ii.) This is one of the only few models in this price range which has a backlit keyboard. If an IPS display truly matters though, you do have some Lenovo, Acer and HP laptops which are <45000. I'm not sure if they have backlit keyboards though.

iii.) The only issue I have (and this applies to all other brands) is the fact that almost all the newer laptop models have really small Up and Down arrow keys which can initially be inconvenient if you use them a lot. In the beginning, my fingers were getting cramped up due to that. It takes a bit of time to get used to them. It's completely fine once you get used to it. However, if you want standard sized arrow keys, get another model. The laptop works smoothly otherwise and is good for everyday use.

iv.) There's no point complaining that games work slowly because this is NOT a gaming laptop. You cannot buy a motorcycle and then complain that it does not fly. If you want a good gaming laptop, shell out more than 1 lakh. The onboard graphics on this is roughly as powerful as a GeForce GTX 765m SLI, a GPU that was released in 2013. If you're playing games from that era, you can play them at 1080p at high settings. Don't expect today's games to run well.

v.) I have found no problems such as poor sound quality (I use earphones most of the time), battery draining quickly etc. After cashback, I got this laptop for Rs. 43,690.5 .

vi.) The build quality isn't very strong. So, use the laptop with care. Be gentle when opening and closing the lid. Place the laptop inside a bag when not in use. Otherwise, constant rough use can damage the shell.

Edit (15-Nov-23): After a year of heavy use, the LCD cover, bezel (the strip around the monitor) and the back case got damaged. I didn't drop the laptop. Just heavy use. At first, I only saw the damage on the first two components. I registered a complaint with Lenovo online. They sent an engineer and replaced those two components under warranty (no extra charge). However, the damage on the third component is something I only observed when the engineer who came to my house for repairs showed it to me. I asked him to contact Lenovo and send the third part too but they said they won't cover it under warranty. I think if I found it the first time around they would have sent all 3 components. Anyway, overall I'm still happy for now. The back case isn't much of a problem for now once the screws are placed in. It just looks like a crack."
,Best budget,Slim and attractive design.
Nikhilesh Bhala,Worst Customer Support and Harassment!!!,"I am a loyal Amazon prime customer and frequently buy products online. Off the late Amazon's post-delivery support has become worst especially on high-value products purchase. This incident has made me lose all the trust on purchasing high-value(>20,000 INR) electronics products online. The 7-Day replacement process is totally misleading and has become a great pain. Below is the detail incident.

Amazon delivered this product ""Lenovo Ideapad-3"" on 06-JUL-2023, Thursday. After unpacking, I powered on the laptop and while going thru the initial settings, I found out that Keypad-1 on the keyboard was not working. This is clearly a hardware issue. So I went about the replacement process and was surprised to find out that first a technician from Amazon will arrive for an inspection and will try to resolve the issue. The technician did not arrive the next day and I had to reschedule again for the next day. So 2 days already lost. Finally the so called technician arrived on 09-JUL-2023, Sunday. The obvious expectation is that he will replace the non-working keypad and resolve. Instead he said he is there only for inspection of any damage and will install and run a diagnostic app which will check for software issues. This is so ridiculous given that the problem is with 1 keypad not working which is a hardware issue. The technician then took a video of the keypad not working and acknowledged the issue and left. I contacted Amazon support and they said that they were waiting for the report from technician and they will contact me after that. No one called anothe 2 days gone and I again followed up today 11-JUN-2023, Tuesday. Shockingly the Amazon support team informed me that the technician has filed a report that issue resolved which is a blatant lie. When I asked them to contact the technician, they were like as per the policy we cannot do that. I just don't understand what is the point in simply beating around the bush with this process and wasting customer's time and harassing the customer like this. Now they said they will arrange for another inspection from technician. This makes no sense as the issue is clearly with hardware. So at the time of writing its 6 days and I am sitting idle with the laptop. The whole point of ordering online is that 7 days replacement guarantee and the confidence. Instead Amazon support simply doing CUSTOMER HARASSMENT and misleading a loyal prime customer. Now I have to wait for the second so called technician to come and not sure what exactly he will do and have no idea as to when the replacement will be done. When we pay the money up-front the expectation is that service and support will work like that. Instead Amazon support is taking CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR GRANTED.
After this incident from here-on, I believe a local retailer is far better when it comes to customer support and accountability. Should NEVER BY A HIGH VALUE PRODUCT ONLINE and 7 DAYS REPLACEMENT PROCESS FROM AMAZON IS TURNING TO A HOAX."
,Unsatisfied,"The biggest pro is its thin. The cons are too many. There is very little brightness and contrast, which means you have to come very close to the computer screen to read. The worst part is the audio quality. Even with headphones it's really disappointing. I regret buying it and will have to live with it as it cannot be returned or exchanged with another laptop. In the meantime continuing to use my old HP which even after 5 years is still good."
MUKHIA,Best buy under 50K....everything an average user needs... Unless you are a hi-fi programmer :),"These license matters a lot:Win 11,Office 2021 home n student - Heartbeat of system.

Advantage:2 yr warranty... Not 1 yr

Adapter is good... All weight at the plug point... fast charging.
Backliy keyboard.... good one. Cam quality is really good...Imp: Cam has shuuter.

Sceeen 15 inch not 15.6 inch but that is almost same.
Fingerprint sensor is not there... Don't be confused. No bag... Purchase separately.

The seller package was awesome.

Color: Arctic Grey is awesome.... You will not regret this color... better than mat or glossy black or silver.

Register your product at Lenovo site and check lenovo warranty... Mine was showing a month before purchase date.

Purchased for online Teaching"
SHASHANK,Good for office use,Good for office work. Battery backup 3 - 4 hours no heating issue
Sudip,Maybe the best student laptop...,"For this price range, this laptop fulfill all the basic needs of a student.
It maybe miss some things like backlit keyboard and anti glare display but for this price, you get what you pay for"
Abhi Singh,not any finger-print scanner present,it is really good
John Yesu,Backlit,"I get it Today... EVERYTHING OK
BUT
There is no backlit keyboard
It's just scam or what ?"
Placeholder,ITS IDEAPAD 1 NOT IDEAPAD 3 AND NO BACKLIGHT FOR KEYBOARD,Not that satisfied with the product. The laptop seems good and as promised it has MS office available with license but there's no backlight keyboard and the warranty is only for 9 months which is kinda frustrating
Jayesh Bhoir,"Screen not colourful, even colourful images looking very dull","Screen not colourful, even colourful images looking"
Stanzin Nurboo,No backlit keyboard as mentioned,"I mainly ordered this laptop for backlit keyboard that is clearly mentioned, but I didn't got any backlit keyboard.
And my laptop shows ideapad 1, but what I ordered was ideapad 3, which is a scam in the name, so yeah a bad experience from the seller and Amazon for the negligence of mistake in the name (the 16 gb varient is mentioned ideapad 1 whereas 8gb varient is mentioned as ideapad 3...👎"
vineet kumar,Worth buying,"Value for money.
There is no lan connector port.
Else it's good laptop"
Austin,Display not satisfactory but rest are great! G,Great design and fast charging is awesome but screen display is not satisfactory
Prime enterprise,great laptop but with a few downsides,"charger is too delicate. I will post again if I get a replacement. If not then the pin has 4mm outer diameter and 1.7mm inner diameter. Just get an off market one from Artis at 60% of price.

8gb is expandable to only 12GB and that too after throwing away existing 4 GB Ram

I thought 8GB will not run out of memory but with 20 odd tabs on 2 different browzers, one excel and a few windows explorer, I do get the message to restart my browzer because of memory shortage."
Teja,Satisfied 🧡,"After 5 days of review
I bought this one from Amazon great
Indian festival..
At this price range(43990) its good choice to buy.
Due to the AMD ryzen 5000series 5500u variant (which is equal to i5 intel) u will get smooth performance and good battery performance u will get minimum 7 hrs for normal usage and all if u work heavily then u will get 5hrs atleast.... It will charge quickly...
not recommended this one for gaming may be u will feel lag.
Screen visibility and display quality is good because it provides anti-glare display. so, u didn't get any reflection while using.
Trackpad is little bit hard to operate.
Keyboard is good and it provides backlit while use on night times.
It will come with ms office and alexa inbuilt
Build quality is quite good not better.
Overall its worth to buy at this price range
Thank you Amazon and Lenovo."
,Good,Good
Placeholder,Go for it,Built quality not up to the mark and sound quality is very poor 😭 even connected to the speakers
Adarsh,Good product,"I am writing this review after one month of usage, at first i got the laptop with some warranty issue so i replaced it and after 10 to 15 days my touchpad was not responding in between and it's used to gets stuck so i called Lenovo customer care and till one week they were updating my driver's and then at last reinstalling windows also didn't solve the issue so now they are replacing the toucpad, hope so it will solve the issue.And regarding screen quality it's really not good but for normal users it does the job , please carefully see the upgradability ,for ram it is only 12gb which is quite less , as 16gb normally all laptop's offers. Battery backup is good. Please check each and every thing within 7 day's as you can get replacement or return within that period bcoz it's better than replacing parts in new laptops. Performance is good."
Brinder singh,Good in the range but not the best,"Firstly , I would like to talk about the screen quality which is below average, I again and again have to set laptop's screen to view , it's viewing angle are the worst as it is not ips display screen quality is not so good .... charging is fast ⏩
How much u can expect from this laptop
Then I would talk about gaming experience which is also not good as it is not a gaming laptop and fps drop drastically which irritates me and heat like hell sometimes while playing normal games too
You can go for it if you buy It for study
At last battery backup is not so good gives 4 hrs of average battery life
Performance wise it is not bad as it is powered with and ryzen 5 , so this was my review and I would say that this laptop will not disappoint u at all"
,Gaming,It's not for gaming. But u can some cup based game(valorant) with low settings. But always use on power supply never use it on battery. Because it will drop performance. Except for this it's is a good laptop for it's price point. It's come with 8gb ram which is good for normal uses. But if u use heavy software (like nox ) it's ram consumption will go to 96%.
Dip Biswas,Recieved a damaged product later got replacement,I bought this in 42990. In this budget it is difficult to get Ryzen 5 processor. When i recieved this product and open it i got a damaged product and the seal was already open. Dont recieve your product if you receive a seal teared product. But later after i continuously contacted with amazon qnd brand. They replaced my product. Over all Laptop is good. Sound and screen could be better. Special screen quality is bad id say. In this budget Rest all is fine.
muqtadir,Sound quality too worst,What I observe in two days that Sound quality is worst. Not light weight. Not worth of money. Battery backup is also worst
,Good buy at this price but not for gamers..u can undoubtedly go with this laptop (students),"Camera quality is poor
Sound is good
AMD processor is fast
Three modes are there - battery saver , best performance and thermal cooling (Fn+Q)
Battery backup is ok not for gaming
Backlit keyboard -2 level of brightness
When u open the lid the system will power on, u need not to on the power button
Display is good with good brightness
Many shortcut keys are there at the top of the keyboard
Something the keyboard is not working, I don't know the reason..but try to remove the usb pin plugged in if any
Correct buy at this price 44k"
Ankit,Met expectations,"An awesome purchase for this price. If your ideal work is studying, coding, you can certainly go for it. One thing was a little disappointing that it's written 8 gigs of ram, but you get usable around only 6 and rest is allocated for graphics. I don't do any gaming so don't have much idea about gaming performance.
I sometimes have some issues of stuck on loading on booting up. That's it. Is it recommended if your budget fits in this price? Yes."
VINITH,Good Product,Product is good 👍 and aesthetic. Value for money.
,"Worst laaptop ever, just now i found out it uses a TN display.","The specifications are set to fool you, nothing works as expected and display is very very poor.

I have wasted my money. I ask lenovo to stop fooling people."
OBAID RAZA,Good in this price range,"Screen brightness not good , fast battery drain, a bit slow."
Elstin,Heating,When we are using continuously it was heating more...
NANAJI DODLA,Good laptop for students and Home,Good laptop
Honest review,Average laptop with average built quality and decent performance,"Good for work and personal use. Built quality would have been better. Artic grey colour is very good which makes the laptop look premium.
Screen with less than HD quality and could have been better.
Got good exchange price for my old lenovo Intel i3 laptop and hence went ahead with this. Would recommend Dell laptops if given a choice between lenovo ones vs other."
Huthik,Not worthy Display,Display viewing angles are very bad.
Karthik,No backlit keyboard,"Even though the title says it has backlit keyboard, I tried everything and found out it doesn't have it, but every other specs is as it was mentioned, but a bit disappointed that it doesn't contain that they claim to be."
Placeholder,No backlit,"Display is awful, no backlit.......totally dissatisfied. Moreover the specification video is of ideapad 3...wow well done Amazon"
Yashank Sakhardande,always want to upgrad but at a my budget,"I loved the product. Although touchscreen is not available for this buy, which i had in product that i had in the past. I get a windows 11, t6 core cpu and alexa, cortana built in for Rs.50,000."
SB,"Build quality is Good, Display is good at this price,","I'm using this for office purpose and and keypad is good battery okay i have not played yet but soon i will edit game review but this is not for gaming only normal gaming can be tolerated by this laptop.
EDIT after playing gta v and velorant I can say it can be good for these types of games for Normal and few hours gaming.But not a gaming laptop Still doesn't seem any issues."
,Awesome product from lenovo,"This model is very fast to operate due to SSD hdd and DDR4 RAM. Though, I observed freezing issues while booting windows 11. I had to take a back and format the laptop which was hectic process to go through.
It's been almost 1 year and product is working fine. Yes battery discharges quickly which is big drawback."
Raghvendra singh,Ek dum bakwas hai Bhai men eleke galti kar di bhai,"Warnty se pehle hi do khrab ho chuka h
Koi part bhi nahi milta h"
NixxVixx,Don't Buy because of screen quality,"I bought this Laptop for my Dad as he wanted to do some normal office work, not some heavy apps or so. In this Budget, the laptop seemed good with Rhyzen 5. Hence we bought it.
The Laptop got delivered to my Father's place hence I could not check it asap. After 1 Month, my Father came to visit me and I noticed the screen. LENOVO GUYS, this quality of screen is not expected even in a Cheap mobile phone now a days and you are proudly selling this Laptop with such a bad screen quality?? I understand this Laptop is cheap but it is not worth this screen. when you say FHD, it should be clear FHD. The screen gas whitish tone and makes it hard for reading. My Dad had no experience with Laptops and Since its one month now, I am stuck with this.. Lenovo, Kindly provide support to upgrade screen. my request."
Talib,Its a good laptop in this price range,Its a good laptop in this price range. But I'm not satisfy with the screen quality. But overall its good... And if you have some extra money then buy graphics card version.
Naveen Rajput,Backlit keyboard,"I purchased this laptop because see thier features but reality there is no backlit keyboard, no finger print lock and no 2 year warranty. I really very disappointed given wrong information by seller."
Saikiran J,Satisfied with the performance,"A very good laptop for the money. Snapy in everyday tasks and heavy computing tasks as well. Could give ~90 fps in e sports titles. The only bad thing is the horrible display. Sitting even slightly closer ( average distance on desk ) will make either of corner looks dark because of very poor viewing angles. The only saving grace is reasonable contrast. I use the laptop mostly with external display. Without an external monitor it's hard to use: sit close and end up with one half of screen looking dark or sit far and look at the tiny 15"" display unable to make out any details."
SHEIK DAWOOD SAIT,It is Good Laptop,"It is good, After using it for 1 week I find its very good for daily tasks and coding but you will get average experience with gaming"
Amareswar Sahoo,Worth of buying after sometime used different different problem.,"Anti glare Display is very very bad. and battery backup I am not satisfied. Over heating issue after normal used. Not expected medium or hard working.
I am using 3 months trackpad loosing problem."
,Backlit keyboard,There is no backlit given in my laptop it's a scam
Keyboard,Built Quality,Buit Quality is not good .....
Wasim Anwar,Automatic wifi will disconnect many times,Poor quality and slow valuem
