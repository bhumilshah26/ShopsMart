,BEST FOR THE BUDGET UNDER 25000,"Awesome experience,just go for it if your work is browsing,ms office, Excel etc,
NOT FOR GAMERS BUT YOU CAN PLAY LOW GRAPHICS GAMES
RAM AND SSD IS NON UPGRADABLE,So keep that in mind, every port is available including type C port(3.2 Gen 1)and RJ45 port
Watching content is excellent,since FHD display, brightness is also above average,

Don't think just buy, suitable for office work,students"
