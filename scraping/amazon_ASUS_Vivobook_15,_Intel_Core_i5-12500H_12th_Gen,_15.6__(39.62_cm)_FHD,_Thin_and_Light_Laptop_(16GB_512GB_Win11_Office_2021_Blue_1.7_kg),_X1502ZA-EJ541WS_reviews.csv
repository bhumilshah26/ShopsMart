. Battery is very good. Very good in multitasking . But no fingerprint scanner in the laptop ."
,A great product to buy with some compromises,"I have been using this laptop for a week now, I gifted this to my father.

Pros:
1.) Great processor at great pricing
2.) Good performance
3.) Windows 11 pre installed
4.) MS Office pre installed
5.) Battery life is descent
6.) Build quality seems descent

Cons:
1.) Majorly the display quality is too poor
2.) Too bad speakers, even the mobile speaker seems louder than this laptop
3.) No windows hello option or thumb print option to login."
shobhit agarwal,Worst product with worst services,"Worst laptop ever used in my life and even the worst services provided by customer care. Speakers of my phone are much better than this laptop speakers. I have raised the complaint, person from service centre came to my house I showed him how low quality these speakers are and even though some consumer of asus also came to my house for his service even his laptop speakers were much better than my laptop. The service center person claims that this model is having this low quality sound its by default by the company without showing any other unit. When i take some meetings i am not able to hear properly, i just need to pull up the laptop and make it close to my ears so that i can hear properly. What is sense of me spending 60 thousand on this shitty laptop, if i am not getting the voice properly and not able to hear the things in meeting or watching series. Totally waste of money. Worst product ever purchased in my life."
Good,Btter in this range,Better performance in this price range and it is good for gaming like gta 5 and also good for coding. Perfect finishing design it work like a smoother
In this price range these buds are good and good noise cancellation also good working sensor but Bluetooth range is not high,3.5 Star rating laptop,"I gave this review after my ten days of user experience. (In my perspective)This laptop is 3.5 rated.

Pros
1. Outstanding processor performance i5 Intel 12500H.
2. Really good for who learn for their stack developer career or testing with heavy software.
3. While trying to play games like mid level or small level really fine.

Cons
1. The first major concern was display quality. No issues with brightness (220nit). I just used 30% display brightness it's more than enough for indoor. Real problem was in display viewing angle. In one direction it shows very perfectly all the displayed content where viewing same thing in different angle it real mess.
2. Webcam quality at this price range (53,000) it's not enough and not good. Especially when you are using at the night time in room light.
3. Fingerprint sensor at this price range even same brand laptops many have fingerprint sensor but this laptop not having that.

No pros and No cons(Moderate)
1. Battery life is really okay. When you are using heavy softwears and gaming something round 3to4 hour of battery life. Whereas using small stuff like watching movies, using small softwares battery stand upto 5 hour.

This laptop advised for whom (In my perspective)

1. Still, I strongly suggested this laptop for who really pursue their career required High-end software. But they not affordable (70,000 - 90,000) laptop.
2. Average gaming experience.

This laptop not advised for whom (In my perspective)

1. The person who perceive the career any designer or UI/UX etc, because of display viewing quality not processor .

Over all I gave 3.5 rated laptop in my perspective."

Mahak s.,Not recommended to buy laptop from Amazon,"In this laptop display, fingerprint censor is showing but when laptop delivered it was not there and tried to contact support lot of times from yesterday but they are not even trying to helping and disconnecting call and putting on hold for longer period of time and the usermanual which is there with the laptop in that it is mentioned that fingerprint censor will be there.
Also, there is no return policy, which is not at all feasible, only service replacement.
I want to return this laptop, and want buy another one in exchange of this but amazon customer support is not helpful.

Cons of this laptop:

Display quality is not good
Sound quality is also not good
Webcam is not good
No fingerprint sensor

Need to return this."
Placeholder,Bad Audio quality ( speaker)& battery performance is low,Sound quality is very low u can't even listen YouTube videos without headphone in quite place also...& Battery need to be improve u can work max upto 4 hours online..
Anshuman Magar,Super fast Laptop,"Bought in Big billion sale. Fast boot speed with Compact Design. Though the upper lead texture got finger prints impression.
In this Price range Finger print sensor is needed."
Prakash,Keep in mind these things,"There is no graphics.
There is no fingerprint or backlit keyboard.
The cam is 720p after paying huge amount.
Display is also ok only.
If you can get any better deals try those.
Sound is also meh.
The whole can be called totally between below average to average.
Its a has lot of short coming so think before you buy"
ANAMIKA DOHREY,Not satisfied,Writing it after using for 3 months. It has started heating so badly when put on charge and even otherwise. So difficult to use it. Not worth it. Cooling is really bad
Rahul Singh,Decent laptop with 16gb ram in this price segment. I got it in 56380.,"Writing it after use of 2 days.

Pros: 16gb ram in this price segment
Look is very decent. Looks very classy❤️
Mouse is very smooth.
Bakclit is there with 3 level of brightness.
Startup time is very less.

Cons:
Company could have worked more on its display. The video quality is not so good. I played video in my phone & laptop simultaneously, got disappointed in that segment.

I guess company claims double audio speaker, but the sound intensity isn't that high. It's normal."
Asus,Good,Product is very good
,Not safe from below,Water can get into your laptop because below there is no any protection for motherboard
Suraj pulekar,Very good processor,It's a very good laptop. Battery backup is little low (approx 2-3 hrs). Very good performance . Look is really very awesome and quality if best. Overall it was a very good laptop.

After using it for 8-9 days, I faced problem in starting the laptop, after that the display was blinking and the keyboard and touchpad were not working.Now the laptop is not turning on, I don't know what is the experience of others but I felt very sorry.
मैंने हाल ही में amazon से एक नया लैपटॉप खरीदा है। 8-9 दिनों तक उपयोग करने के बाद, मुझे लैपटॉप चालू करने में समस्या का सामना करना पड़ा, उसके बाद डिस्प्ले ब्लिंक कर रहा था और कीबोर्ड और टचपैड काम नहीं कर रहे थे। अब लैपटॉप चालू नहीं हो रहा है, मुझे नहीं पता कि दुसरो का क्याअनुभव है , लेकिन मुझे बहुत दुःख हुआ।"

The seller showd in imeage and video that it has a fingerprint sensor,,

Hinges are not smooth, if you open the screen it can lift whole body with that, can't open it by one hand"
,Disappointing Experience with Asus VIVOBOOK 15 from Amazon's Great Indian Festival,"I recently purchased the Asus VIVOBOOK 15 during the Amazon Great Indian Festival, and I've had a rather frustrating experience with it. After using the laptop for just 30 minutes upon receiving it, the screen's backlight suddenly went out and hasn't come back on since. This issue has recurred multiple times over the past few days. I reached out to Amazon Customer Service, and they sent a technician to my house. Unfortunately, the technician could only offer a return, and I was hoping for a replacement, which they don't seem to have as an option. This has been quite disappointing."
Ayush,Good,"This is valuable money, good specification good feature"
,Waste of money (no Finger print reader),"Don't buy asus laptop

Amazon Customer,Terrible mistake,"Not working, charging light not working."
anil. nithar,good for my work,good
,Not expect this from brand like ASUS,"The buil quality processesor, graphics, storage and everything is fine even 16 GB of RAMl in this price range is awesome. But there is no backlit and finger print scanner. I have bought a low price HONOR and even they are providing finger print scaner. So, please if some features is not available in the product don't mention/show in on web page. I could easily give 5 star if these features are not even shown here."
KD,No fingerprint scanner,"Battery life is OK, and not Value for money is the same money there are many options, The Display is OK, and there is no Heating I observed, especially no fingerprint scanner as shown in ads on marketing pics or videos. This is a big disappointment."

Amazon Customer,Assus,Good and Compatible👍Laptop Good for Softwares like Auto CaD Civil 3D Open Roads Global Mapper Google Earth CAD Tools etc
Rakesh N.,Got this laptop from Chroma after using it for sometime,Overall the quality seems pretty nice and if you check the hardware its quite a hardcore machine with a good processor
Manikanta Gandrothu,Good,"Value for money good budget laptop for users

Subir B.,The worst in tech laptop,"The most 3rd class laptop this never worth the price I wasted my money 😞😢😢 the worst screen makes it trash
"" Never buy this laptop"""
,Worst laptop in segment,"No extra slot for storage
Very slow processor
Worse camera quality
Very bad very bad very bad very bad very bad"
TUSHAR,Get Defective item,"Get Defective item , I order for my Friend ... On appario + Amazon trust .
Kindly replace the item"
AADIL,"Best one , go for it",The best laptop in this price range with powerful processer. the only drawback is it doesn't have fingerprint scanner and everything else is amazing
,Best laptop in price segment,"I like the colour of the laptop. Laptop is easy to handle. laptop weight is 1.7 kg so it's light weight. Laptop boothing time is very good,I am very happy. Screen comes with 15.6 inch display. Display quality is descent. I think I would suggest purchase any amoled display in the laptop. It's comes with 12500h powerful processor with lifetime Microsoft office 2021 and student access. I think it's good choice for all working like coding, descent gaming, office purpose, video editing, best for tech. But laptop is sometimes heating on gaming. Overall asus vivobook 15 ( 16gb ram, 512gb) is good choice for all of you."
