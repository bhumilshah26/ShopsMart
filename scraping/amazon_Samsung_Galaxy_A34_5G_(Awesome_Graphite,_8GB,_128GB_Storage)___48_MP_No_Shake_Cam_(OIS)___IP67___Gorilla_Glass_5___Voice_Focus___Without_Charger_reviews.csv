Placeholder,Good product for price,Good mid range phone if you don't want to spend much on flagships. Downside is feels little bulky and heavy but also feels sturdy. No issues with performance for everyday tasks. Better option if you don't trust Chinese brands. Decent battery backup lasts for a day. It has samsung wallet makes upi payments easier. Secure folder is also a great feature for having private data and you can also have hidden apps like WhatsApp inside secure folder. Minimum bloatware on oneui but you can disable it. Camera looked good compared to my old oneplus 7t. Overall good purchase.

For my poor experience with Samsung m31 I was to buy redmi or honor the new unbreakable series as these phones are very sturdy stable reliable and highly customizable but my Samsung galaxy watch 6 classic does not support any other phone but Samsung only, for features like ECG and blood pressure so I had to be with Samsung
I am happy but because I use moderately and take good care of my phone like a baby and is always in cover I will be truly happy if it lasts with no complains for 5 years at least
Use a branded charger please !!!

For this price of 24.3 k it‚Äôs not a bad choice go for it"
Ram,Good,"Really good phone,I expected a laggy phone but its fast. The file transfer time compared to my oneplus 7t is too much. Good for the price though,fast for everyday use,I don't game so no worries for me.
Camera is bad,expected better.takes worse pics than my oneplus 7t.Doesnt have telephoto too.Main cam is OK.and also there's a useless macro cam. Don't buy if your priority is camera.
Performance- fast for everyday use.social media,web browsing ans stuff.Never felt laggy. Don't think it's good for gaming,I don't game so I don't know.
Battery- battery is really good. First few days I felt it was draining fast,but now it lasts a really long time.
Charging- charges from 5-85% in 50-55mins,I don't charge past 85 for battery health.
Screen- screen is actually very big and also it's super ambled,very nice screen.
UI- oneui is amazing. So many features. Bixby is good too.
Speaker- just wow.Very impressive. Really loud and good clarity too
Conclusion- I got it for 27,350 , buy it if you want a phone with 4 years os updates,no other brands offer this many updated at this price. Don't buy if you are looking for an impressive camera or a gaming phone."
Ayush,Camera is good,Battery draining issue . From day 1 And every thing else is fine
Rakesh Solanki,"Vibrant Display Marred by Battery Drainage and Heating Issues""","Here‚Äôs an overview based on my experience:

**Display:**
The display is vibrant and offers crisp visuals, enhancing the overall user experience. Whether you're watching videos, browsing the web, or gaming, the display quality does not disappoint.

**Performance:**
Despite promising hardware specifications, the mobile's performance is hindered by its battery-related issues. While navigating through applications and multitasking, users may encounter lag and sluggishness, detracting from the overall user experience.

**Battery Life:**
One of the most significant drawbacks of this mobile is its poor battery performance. The battery drains rapidly, even with minimal usage, which can be frustrating for users who rely heavily on their devices throughout the day. Additionally, the extended charging time exacerbates this issue, making it inconvenient for users to quickly replenish their battery life.

**Heating Problems:**
Another concerning issue is the device's tendency to become excessively hot during usage and while charging. This not only poses discomfort to users but also raises concerns about potential long-term damage to the device's internal components.

**Overall Impression:**
While the mobile device offers impressive design, display, and performance on paper, its persistent battery drainage, prolonged charging time, and heating problems significantly detract from its overall appeal. Unless these issues are addressed through software updates or hardware improvements, potential buyers may want to consider alternative options that offer better battery life and thermal management.

In conclusion, while the mobile device has its merits, the aforementioned battery-related issues severely impact its usability and reliability, ultimately making it a challenging recommendation in its current state."
R2D2,"Good phone, moderately good camera","Great screen, speakers are nice. Camera is better than average. Battery lasts 2 full days with moderate use. Definitely worth the price considering regular updates and display quality"
Sanjay Bhavsar,Good phone overall beget,"Battery backup almost two days are working, Display is good, dual 5G network good working, nice photography, weight is highly and no slimes, but phone is good üëå"
ABHISHEK BANERJEE,A decent phone for this price,The phone is good for day to day usage. Both fornt and rear Camera is good. Pictures taken are of very good quality. Speaker of the phone is loud enough( stero speaker). Software is up-to-date. But the price is little high for this phone.
naveed illahi,Must read before purchasing.,"First and foremost I would like to say that there is nothing great about this smartphone. What I mean is this is a jack of all trades kind of thing.
1. Design and display - Look wise this thing is a beauty. Weight is slightly higher than what I would like but not a deal breaker. That nipple notch people complain about is not even an issue as your brain automatically gets used to it fairly quickly.
Coming to display this is my first samsung phone and as everyone says samsung panels are the best and they are not wrong. Sharpness is great,colors produced are excellent and black and whites are rich and detailed all the way. Brightness is more than good enough for both outdoor use and use in dark room at night as it does get very dim so your eyes don't strain as much.
2. Camera - Both rear and front produce really good photo and video quality given the lighting conditions are good. Low light quality is decent enough. Photos come out a little saturated but nothing over the top. Although sometimes I feel there is a slight shutter lag when there are lots of details in the frame. Front camera produces ample details and good skin tones.
3. Performance- There is no lag in the UI or any heavy apps . Everything runs buttery smooth provided 120hz refresh rate setting is always on. I did some casual gaming and there were no frame drops or jitters whatsoever. Also I would like to add if you want to go for heavy gaming you would want to go to game launcher settings and turn high performance mode and also a setting that turns on high frame rate with touch controls. All in all this is more than good enough for 90% of things you throw at it.
4. Battery - After reading many mixed reviews I was quite skeptical about battery life but man was I proven wrong. After finishing setup and installing 30plus apps I full charged my phone and did a complete one day (24hrs)heavy usage to check battery life . I easily got 8plus SOT on mixed 5g and wifi ,screen brightness ranging from 30-80%. Usage ranged from social media, YouTube, camera , some games, phone customization and both network and whatsapp calls. Battery idle drain is also very minimal.
5. Speakers - This is where things get weird. Don't get me wrong the sound is Rich loud and dare I say brilliant. But there is one issue. Whenever you turn Dolby atmos on and keep volume around 40% the back panel near the bottom will vibrate and its the annoying kind of vibrations. I tried with a case but there was not much difference. You need to learn to hold slightly differently or ignore it.
6. Price - After coupons and bank offers I got a pretty good deal and feel like this is a value for money phone. (Avoid it if you get it around 28k or more.)
7. Charging- There is no charger provided so add another 1k to your total budget. Charging while on the slow side comparatively a 25 W samsung charger takes around 25 minutes to go from 20-85% which is the range we should be charging our phones anyway to make the batteries working life as long as possible so charging time is not an issue for me personally .
8. Network - Network seems to be good enough on both 5g ,LTE and wifi. No call drops or voice breaks whatsoever. Internet speeds are very good as well.
9. Fingerprint sensor - This is another area which has annoyed me . Setting up fingerprints is easy but very rarely it just behaves like a stubborn child and doesn't want to work at all. I needed to restart the device two times which fixed the issue. Otherwise most of the times it's reliable( works 9/10 attempts) and decently fast ( takes .75 seconds approximately).

This is it guys . All in all a good device with very few compromises. Heavy gamers should look elsewhere though. I would update review after a major update is available. Thank you."
Pratik J Trivedi,Good product,Product is good but battery life is not good it reduce fast.
Mahir Kapadia,Nice,Good one
Suman Das,VALUE FOR MONEY,First impression is good . Product has delivered yesterday so i have to use it quit more to know about the quality But they maintioned its anti fingerprint but it totally false.

Gopinath R.,Battery Problem,Features are awesome but battery drains fast.....it drains after 4 hours
,Best product,It is awesome üëå
SATVIK GUPTA,Samsung always rocks,The quality of Samsung phones is absolutely great.
Mithu,Overall 3.5/5. Pros & cons:,"Pros:
1. Display- peak brightness (1000 nits)works well in moderately sunny environments... 120hz refresh rate no lag in app shifting or video playback... Works well for mid size games but not a gaming mobile.
2. One UI- excellent camera software, customisable wallpapers, widgets, panels. Better multitasking and background app functioning
3. No problems of over heating so far even with a 500mAh battery smaller than M series
4. Under display finger print is highly accurate
5. Daylight/high light photography is excellent, even videography. Sensors are great, can easily focus on subject, adjust brightness and provide beautification options
6. Excellent device care, person well being and blue light filter options to monitor your usage and longevity of phone
Cons:
1.500mAh battery does not last over 3-4hrs if you're a heavy user... Lasts for about a day and a half if you are light user which is a confusing problem.. especially considering it has a better processor and chipset than it's successor a54..
2. Low-light photography is the worst.. 0/5. Phones of less than half price in Mseries have better sensors... main Camera does not focus and goes blur/grainy at night, selfie camera is nothing but grainy in low light conditions... Disappointing as it's such an easily fixable issue. Ultrawide camera is less than impressive, loses overe 40% detail and clarity in again low light situations.
3. Videography is great, but if using the super steady mode in against the sun conditions or in light shifting conditions, camera takes a good few seconds to adjust, about 20% clarity and brightness is lost in this mode as well.

Neutral:
Camera technology in the hardware is optimal (not impressive because it's easily expected of a mid range priced phone) but the AI and software work of the camera is surprising... Can't decide yet if it's good or bad. The photos which are presented are noticeably processed and beautified which in cases of portraits or night photos can be useful but at the same time an essence of rawness and reality is lost when checking landscape pictures or macro pictures..."

Bala,Nice Phone... Audio jack disadvantage,"it was Nice Phone and decent audio and picture quality . if you use continues 5g one day battery life.
main problem is Type c Audio jack it will not support all type C connector you have to go Bluetooth earphone or Samsung type c earphone that is the main disadvantage."
Rony Patra,DEPENDABLE and secure phone,"I have been using this phone for 4 months now. I used to operate a Redmi K20 Pro before this, and, if I'm being honest, there are certain things I miss about the K20 Pro, which are not there in this phone, such as a good selfie camera, and superfast charging.

But this phone is otherwise a solid phone for daily use. Battery life is very good, and can easily last a day with heavy use. Considering that most mid-range Samsung phones have Exynos chipsets these days, which are notorious for their heating problems, the Mediatek chipset ensures there's no heating on my model even after heavy use.

The front camera might not be good, but the rear camera setup is extremely good, especially the night mode (though I wish Samsung had provided astrophotography mode on this model).

The phone is also very secure, and unlike Xiaomi phones, where you can't uninstall their apps, Samsung gives you the freedom to uninstall the apps. Samsung Wallet is also a plus point, because it allows you to use credit/debit cards on POS machines by simply tapping your phone. Other people might be used to this feature, but for me, this is extremely helpful.

I have my reasons for buying this phone. Obviously, if you have more money, you can go for other better phones, or even Samsung's S-series. However, I would say this is a far better phone than the Samsung Galaxy A54, and, once prices come down a bit in a few months, this will be an ever better deal. If you're looking for a DEPENDABLE mid-range Samsung phone, I would advise you to go for it."
Tejpal,Very good mobile,Good condition
Praveen,Basic review,Slow charging as compare to in this price segment smart phone i had purchased @22k 256 gb variant in great indian festival all things is preety good as compared to the chinese brand it gives 5 yr of software support which is good for long term use
Upendra Bapat,One of the best est phone at this cost,"I am using Samsung A50 for the last 4 years. I am very satisfied with it and wanted A series phone only. A34 5G provided me exactly what I was looking for. It is slightly bulky as compared to the A50. I have the 8 / 128 model. I have used it for a month now. It is working seamlessly. I am a photographer and the triple camera with the Pro-mode is not fancy but really good for a mobile. The applications run smoothly. (and I have about 100 of them) There wasn't any heating issue while using or changing.The Android version is upgradable. The battery is solid and easily holds through a day for my usage of about 5 hours a day.

The mobile connectivity, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi are working without any glitch. The finger print sensor is on the screen and so far working smoothly. Overall it is one of the best phone from a reputed brand in this price range."

Dr. R. K. Bhuiya,"Very poor battery, from 100% it comes to 66% in just two hours of minor usage",I bought this phone only for samsung 1UI experience and 5000 MAH battery. Very disappointed with battery performance. Have no idea whether samsung can fix this in phone updates.
Rafiq Shaikh,Samsung Galaxy A34 on Great Festival sale,Quality is good. STURDY design and great to hold and touch this phone. Must Buy for Samsung Lovers. However performance vise and camera department needs improvement. Average Video Shooting experience.
