sravani gupta,Amazing Product,"The Apple iPhone 14 is overall a great phone for anyone who is looking for high speed, excellent camera quality, and a day-long of battery life. The squared-off sides are more comfortable to hold in your hand in my opinion. I purchased this one and so far my experience has been wonderful. Something I like about this phone is its fast speed along with the different options the camera gives you. I wouldn't say the iPhone 14 has a better camera than the 13, rather I think they are more similar and there wasn't a dramatic improvement. The battery life is something that I wish was a little longer. It last about an hour or two more than the average iPhone 13, but does charge faster. I have been able to receive about a 50% charge in 30 minutes. Another great feature of this phone is the painless eSIM setup. Being able to set up the SIM card virtually and not a physical transfer on your phone makes carrying over carriers from phone to phone much easier. battery lasts as long as the iPhone 13. As you may remember, it was much better than the iPhone 12. The iPhone 14 is a smooth, responsive phone and great for high-quality gaming or photo and video editing. Overall I think this is a great phone to purchase if you are looking for a durable and sustainable upgrade and I do think it is worth the extra hundred dollars from the 13."
Placeholder,iPhone 14,Good Phone
Aryan,Pretty good phone,"The color is really good first of all and the Performance is obviously more than enough for my usage, Camera quality and everything else is pretty good except the battery life because that‚Äôs alright and not the best as i have experienced better to be honest but it does provide battery life for a whole day till now and from what i‚Äôve heard it will maintain to do so till it reaches approximately 95% battery health. I personally feel like this model is really value for money in comparison to other models of iPhone 14 series since iPhones with higher storage are generally heavily overpriced."
Jayakrishnan,"It's visually appealing and upgraded device, surpassing my old iPhone 12","Pros:

Good Looking (4/5): The Blue color variant adds to the aesthetic appeal, making the iPhone 14 an eye-catching device.

Better than iPhone 12 (4/5): The iPhone 14 exhibits improvements over the iPhone 12, contributing to an enhanced user experience.

Good Camera (4/5): The camera performance is commendable, capturing high-quality images and enhancing the overall photography experience.

In summary, the Apple iPhone 14 in Blue is a solid choice, offering a sleek design, improved features compared to the iPhone 12, and a reliable camera for capturing memorable moments."
Prasanna,Exceeding my expectation. Go for it.,"About the phone
Apple phone without a second delay, I would say it is better than all android phones I have used. The phone is like water, it flows in a way you want and shaping in your way. In a best way possible, the phone is designed to only show what the user wants and eliminating unnecessary ads, features that I have seen in android.

Why it is better than Android?
You pay too much money for Apple products, obviously you experience the features, physical components , camera lens etc. Apart from basic things, you can also enjoy the best applications available in app store. If you are a developer you might know the app store policy for application publish and their security posture towards handling payment apps etc. They publish best application and the way the apps, its modules switches is just flawless. Due to the so called strict policy of privacy program with Apple products, iPhone can pop up a box in your screen if any apps wants to track your activity with other applications. +1 respect for apple to show such concern with user.

Apple phones are same ? like 13 vs 14
The reason 14 is same as 13 may be business practice followed from 11th edition. But please note that iPhone making changes internally like physical components (small change in battery performance, lens in 14 edition), additional features but that may not satisfy you to buy 14 edition. If you do not find ""the very few changes"" interesting in 14, go for 13. Because physical and even cameras are not visually very much different in 13 vs 14 comparison. Also you get 13 for cheap :)
14 is just added features but that is not for daily use, the features real time use is rare case. But the best part is there is no extra cost between 13 vs 14 prices (except extra 10k slash)

Concern you must have.
Apple is not giving chargers and their silicon cases are very expensive (but very good in touch and scratch friendly in back due to silk layer). This is an issue for sure. You have to buy charger not coming with USB C and claiming that you help carbon footprint, understandable but not customer friendly business model. Even after the purchase I had to spend at least 7k for charger and case.

Apple care.
I am not buying it, I pay for phone which is already expensive for this premium and apple care does have strict policy that if you understand that is waste. Instead I find a private insurance to make things better."
Rahul Sharma,Excellent phone,Better than One Plus
Simran shrivastava,Very happy,"The blue colour looks amazing, very happy to purchase my 1st Iphoneü•∞"
Kunaal,Buttery smooth,"Using iphone 14 for over a week now, its just buttery smooth as expected the display is so amazing and the animations are done so precisely that you will actually forget that this has 60hz display. In term of camera quality back camera is really good, I don‚Äôt like the selfie camera that much but i am not a selfie person so its fine with me. Battery is also good will give you upto 6-7hr backup"

Previously I have heard lot of rumours about the iPhone not to buy on sale but when I bought this it was completely game changer for me. Specially the camera quality and Siri does half of my work. I am happy with the purchase. Thank you Amazon for serving the best."

Praveengouda P.,Amazing is the only word - shifted from Android to Iphone,"This review is for the people who want to shift from Android to Apple as I did .
I used Xiaomi K20 pro as my last device .
I have been an mi phone for last 10 years and was happy with the value for money offered from the mi and also the camera was top notch for the prices .
Fast forward to 2023 , I brought apple 14 , I always wanted to buy iPhone but due to battery back up and high costs I kept postponing.
And believe me iPhone is not a smart phone to be compared with any android phones , this is in league of its own , so no comparison of orange to apple for sure.

Silky smooth ui, touch screen , camera , sound , display , battery back up : Simply superb.

You may face little difficulties in shifting to iPhone but little patience is all you need and you will love it for sure"
,Nice,Nice

shankarnarayan,Average phone,"Delivery experience was very good and i received genuine product.

Phone review:
The phone is nothing extra ordinary. The features of the phone are as par compared to basic mid-range budget phones from andriod.
As far as camera goes the dynamic range of is it very good without any much color correction.
Rest every thing is just average.
You should go for this only if your an apple user fan or you always wanted an iphone."
Sharath,Use an Iphone for a month before planning to buy it over Android.,"It is just a review from my side so that its good for you to know before buying rather than regretting later.

Positives:
* Showoff
* Camera
* Sound
* Security (they say, bt that blocks so many accessibility options for me)
* So many awesome features as all iphone users say (which probably I will use once in a lifetime)

Negatives for me (You may like it):
1. No shortcut to change between vibration and no vibration frequently.
2. No end call button on the lock screen.
3. Call list is nonsense. It shows phone, whatsap and all other calls in same list.
4. Go to a specific contact in call history n you can see only history of one day. Total length of call history is 100. Most probably you will not be able to find call history of previous week for a specific contact.
5. Need of Itunes to copy music from PC to phone.
6. No file manager like android where we can see and access complete folder structure.
7. No silent and vibrate mode notification on screen.
8. Need to buy separate adapter n earphones after already spending double.
9. Cannot remove torch icon in iphone14 from lock screen. You may end up switching it on unwillingly.
10. BT and WiFi shortcuts will just disconnect them. To turn off you need to go to Settings screen and turn it off again.
11. In so many places, either text or files, there is no Select All option. (I'm waiting for android users to get all pics received in whatsapp after a trip).
12. Takes a lot of time to get detected by devices when hotspot is on.
13. At some screen you get stuck and you will miss the back button.
14. Copy some mp3 files to your iphone and you will never be able to find it with default music app.
15. Every app will be either on lot of home screens or organised under some groups. You will never get a clean home screen with 2 or 3 most frequently used apps and all other apps in a swipe up menu like android.
16. No fingerprint sensor.

Adding to the list after using for 2 months:
17. Cannot turn off camera shutter sound in general mode.
18. No option to flag contact as spam/scam.
19. If you connect wireless BT device, it won't show battery percentage of BT device.
20. You get a notification while using phone and you miss to open it, then you will not see it until you remember yourself to open notification screen. Notification icons won't be pinned on top of the screen like Android.
21. If you use 2 SIM and want to switch mobile data between SIMs, there is no shortcut than going to Settings screen. Also, cannot see current amount of data used or left.

List goes on and on, try it yourself.. No iphone owner speaks about limitations. Some people like iphone for these and others hate it for these. If you can pay double and handle these adjustments with work arounds, go ahead. Once you unlock and give your phone to someone, or once you give access permissions to apps, even iphone is not most secure. Fr example, If you are driving and someone wants to use your phone for music/maps etc., then you have to give your password, because there is no fingerprint option and face recogniton feature will become dangerous option."
Sanathan Juturu,Apple Just Wow wow wow!,Awesome phone and Amazon only fulfilled my wish. Thank you for fulfilling my dream.
,Feels like a duplicate product,Not sure how to check authenticity of the product
sanjay,Awesome üòäüëåüèª,Awesome phone üòä‚úåüèª
Shashank Shekhar Ojha,A great phone for minimalist like me.,"I prefer to have some privacy in life, I think apple suite is bit more private than google. It respects user privacy if you are not using third party apps. My options were stock android without google (something like lineageOS) or iPhone. I tried lineageOS but there was always something breaking in my phone. It couldn't become my daily driver; I wish most of the things in android were open source like maps and some other proprietary google apps. In the current state, I was left with choosing iPhone. For long, I had debated with myself about buying iPhone or not, I was using OnePlus 7T for last 3.5 years. The phone stopped getting updates and had many bugs. The software changed a lot, I hated it. All these OEM betraying consumers made me switch to iPhone in the end. I can't trust any other brand to have the consistency like apple has. That's my take in the phone market. I wish there was a consistent bloat free android brand with a great camera."
Sam,üçé Name is enough,"Just Wow, amazing product"
ROSHAN DHANAI,If you don‚Äôt want to wait for iphone 15 then buy it,"Pros:
1. Powerful A15 Bionic chip
2. Beautiful OLED display
3. Excellent camera quality
4. Long-lasting battery life
5. Secure Face ID authentication
6. Up to 5 years of software updates

Cons:
1. Expensive
2. No major design changes from the iPhone 13
3. No headphone jack
4. No expandable storage

Overall, the iPhone 14 is a great phone, but it's not a major upgrade over the iPhone 13. If you're looking for a new iPhone, the iPhone 14 is a good option, but you may want to consider waiting for the iPhone 15, which is expected to have more significant changes."
