Binu,Best(Branded) Budget TV,"Before finalizing the AUE60 55"", I visited Croma and Vijay Sales to check for the same TV or similar models for their features and picture quality. I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55"" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I'll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.

Why I went for AUE60 vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn't be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on.

Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.

Sound:
Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV's speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.

Picture:
The Panel's great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn't great(i.e. gray tones won't be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there'll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren't perfectly black - and they're brighter than you'd expect from a VA panel, but this isn't noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I'd like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I'd say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.

Connectivity:
I have a 35 Mb/s broadband connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there's no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.

Apps & Features:
Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can't produce the contrast you'd expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.

Remote:
Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote's looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that's about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you'll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung's SmartThings App, but guess what - you can't even use your phone's keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it's not there yet.

Attached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV's design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.

I'd say I'm really happy - and given the chance, wouldn't change my decision. It's a Samsung TV, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than I expect, I can overlook all other cons. I'd highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TV."
,TV is very good,"TV features, display, response, audio, connectivity etc are good but remote control started malfunctioning after 1.6 years"
Dhanya N.,Impressive Picture Quality and Smart Features,"I recently purchased the Samsung 138 cm (55 inches) 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV UA55CU8570ULXL (Titan Grey), and overall, I'm quite satisfied with my purchase. Let's start with the positives.

The picture quality is undeniably impressive. The 4K Ultra HD resolution delivers stunning clarity and detail, making movies, TV shows, and even gaming a pleasure to watch. The colors are vibrant, and the contrast is excellent, providing a truly immersive viewing experience.

I also appreciate the sleek design of the TV. The Titan Grey finish adds a touch of elegance to my living room, and the slim bezels give the impression of a larger screen size, maximizing the viewing area.

However, I do have a few minor gripes with the smart features of this TV. While it does come with a variety of pre-installed apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube, I found the user interface to be a bit clunky and slow at times. Navigating through menus and switching between apps can be somewhat sluggish, which can be frustrating, especially when trying to quickly access content.

Additionally, I encountered some issues with connectivity, particularly when trying to connect to my home Wi-Fi network. Although I eventually managed to establish a stable connection, it took longer than expected and required some troubleshooting.

Overall, while the Samsung UA55CU8570ULXL offers impressive picture quality and a sleek design, its smart features could use some improvement in terms of responsiveness and connectivity. That being said, considering its reasonable price point for a 55-inch 4K TV, it still represents good value for money."
Jayanna T M,Apple airplay and Samsung tv plus are the main advantages,"I purchased this in Amazon festive sale, 43 inches is my requirement. I have searched so many brands on internet and chosen this. I have observed that film maker mode automatically enabled for few movies on Amazon prime it’s really good. consider below points if you want to purchase a tv in mid range.

1)good picture quality. Viewing angles fine. Filmmaker mode is very good.
2) Samsung tv plus - you can watch channels like discovery, animal planet, 9xm, kids channels like pogo..etc, news channels ndtv,ask Tak, etc, and few movie channels
3) workspace- Samsung wireless display feature for PC, used this feature very useful.
I have connected mi box to my tv, displaying videos very smoothly and sound also good thanks to the Samsung os.
4)coming to build quality - it’s good compared to other brands, tv mounting legs are not having screws which is simple but innovative.
5)sound quality is nice but not much loud, external speakers are needed if you want to louder sounds
6) remote is not having voice search feature which is one drawback. But you can use smart connect app for easy typing.
Looking forward if Samsung at least enable this feature in smart connect app.

7) coming to the software it is very easy and anyone can use effortlessly. Tizen is is good, it supports Apple air play which is great advantage. Most of the tv’s in the market won’t support Apple airplay.

8) IOT - there are multiple brands can support this smart tv. Expecting smasung to support Wipro smart devices as well.

Before purchasing I have considered build quality, warranty, service centre’s, picture quality, sound quality, brand reputation. Other brands which may give QLED in this price, the picture & sound quality & won’t be good."
,Overall An Excellent Product!,"I recently purchased this Samsung product on 20 Feb 23. TV design, features, response, audio, display & overall experience with it just amazing. The delivery was prompt with quick installation. Packing & documents were up to date. The 4K Ultra HD display resolution produces stunningly clear & impressive pictures. Gaming & smart features are impressive. There are no cons as such.
Hence, this Samsung product is highly recommended and worth watching in an appropriate size family room."
Nagaraju_b,Exllent picture quality,"The TV picture quality is good for the price, the sound would have been a little better, everything else is very good, but there is a little lag.I bought it in republic sale for 26000 Amazon delivery is also very good we are Samsung family"
,Purchased it Again,"Purchased this model again. Earlier I had purchased it in Oct-2023 for myself and now for my parents. I am extremely satisfied with the overall quality of Samsung TVs. Picture quality is very good, it is simple to set up and operate and comes at a reasonable price.

Big fan of Samsung."
Vaishali Pusdekar,Nice picture quality but lags in sound. Should have Dolby atmos,Good TV in the price range but obviously not Great as other companies like Hisense and TCL are offering Q-LED TV in this price. Got it at a great discount on Amazon Republic Sale. Overall 4 stars and deducted 1 star because of lack of good sound support. Should have provided Dolby Atmos. 20 Watt dual speakers are not sufficient and lacks surround sound.
,Almost perfect,"Everything is great, the only drawback I can see is that I sometimes wish it was a little brighter. On a sunny day in a well lit room you sometimes need to close your curtains."
Suresh,Great picture quality but sounds needs improvement and doesn't have voice assistant.,"I really liked the picture quality of the TV, thank you Samsung for that.
However, it needs improvement for sound quality and sound watt probably. Less sound compared to other TVs. You might need to buy a sound bar.

It doesn't have an option to voice search, so this is a big disadvantage."
Sameer Khan,Disappointing experience with recurring panel issues,"Certainly! Here's a refined ver

I purchased a Samsung TV at start of 2023(55 inch a big investment for middle class folks), and within just 2.5 weeks of installation, I encountered a screen failure. Despite contacting the company, I was informed that only the panel would be replaced, which took 2 to 3 weeks to complete. Unfortunately, after 8 to 9 months, the same issue resurfaced, rendering the TV unusable once again.

While the engineer assigned to the case was sympathetic, the company continually insisted on replacing the panel rather than providing a new TV. After weeks of back-and-forth, I reluctantly accepted the panel replacement, realizing the company had no intention of offering a more satisfactory resolution.

In total, within the first 10 months of ownership, my TV was non-functional for a significant portion of time, totaling around 40 days. This experience has left me deeply dissatisfied with Samsung's customer service and overall product quality. I hope this feedback serves as a cautionary tale for potential buyer's.

Needless to say feeling trapped with the issue I had to invest in extending my warranty for another 2 to 3 years, which is a smart thing to do.

The product is great but my experience has been horrific and in constant fear when next panel issue will pop up..."
,Overall,"I'm delighted with this TV! It has great picture quality, especially for the price. The smart features are also very user-friendly and I love accessing all my favorite streaming apps easily. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for a great value 4K smart TV."

,Amazing TV at a budget,"I don't use a dth/ cable and was looking for a lag free software to watch OTTs. Impressed with the performance till now. No lags, Nice angles.

Sahil Rathod,A Rollercoaster Ride with Samsung TVs,"I recently took the plunge into the world of smart TVs, starting with the Samsung i Smart Cue60 model from Amazon. At first, everything seemed peachy keen, but my excitement quickly plummeted when I discovered four pesky dead pixels just a few days into the TV affair. 🙄
Kudos to Amazon's customer service, though—they swooped in with efficiency after my distress call. Despite the pixel debacle, they swiftly processed my refund, leaving me both grateful and TV-less. 🛍👏
Undeterred, I decided to give it another shot and turned to Flipkart for a second act, choosing the Samsung Cue70 model with its promising Assistant feature. Well, fate had a different script for me this time. Lo and behold, I unwrapped a used TV with questionable packaging and a rather prominent dead pixel. 😓
Frustrated with the cycle of returns, I sought advice from a tech-savvy friend who nonchalantly informed me that dead pixels are the norm in LED TVs. Armed with a two-year warranty, I decided to keep the TV, throwing caution to the wind. I even opted for an extra year of coverage, playing the long game. 🎮
Whether this gamble pays off or not is a cliffhanger in itself. As I embark on this uncertain TV journey, I feel compelled to warn potential buyers of the Cue60 and Cue70 models—brace yourselves for the dead pixel roulette; chances are, you might find yourself spinning the wheel. 🎰
For the rest of us, let's not sweat the small stuff—these are just materialistic things. Life has more important matters to offer. Here's to staying calm and embracing the uncertainties of the electronic world! Cheers to a pixel-perfect future or not. 😇🍻"

Leela,Value for money,One of the most profitable purchase considering the price and how long a tv lasts.
Subhasis patra,Be ready to pay more at the time of installation,"As one would like to replace HDMI, USB,
the wall mounting that comes with in the box is a fixed mounting, which is of hardly any use.

The installation guy will bring a flexibile mounting and charge you between 2000-2500₹ for this change.
Charges at the time of reporting to Samsung are zero.
Samsung should consider providing flexible wall mounting to avoid extra expense of customer"
,Samsung TV,"Best TV Samsung products is always best Samsung is a brand which provides best product and most important service is very good.
But volume is low if volume feature more high then it was 100 percent and 5 out of 5 but it can be manageable."

Swadesh,Amazing product.,"I recently purchased the Samsung crustal vision 4K Smart TV, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations in every aspect.

The only suggestion for samsung is to place the LAN port along with other ports. The current position makes it quite difficult to adjust with back wall."
,I am facing problem with the Voice Assistant-the Option is missing totally,"Sir,
After a period of 7 months, the Voice Assistant is missing from the ""General-Voice Menu"". Today (29-02-2024), I have lodged a complaint with our Local Samsung Technical Support Team."

Sumeet Kumar Mishra,Excellent Visual Experience with Room for Audio Improvement,"I recently purchased the Samsung 43-inch Smart TV and have been thoroughly impressed with its stunning visual display and smart features. The crisp images and vibrant colors make every viewing experience enjoyable.

While the overall performance deserves a solid 5 stars, I must note that the sound quality is average. Although it gets the job done, audiophiles may find it lacking in depth and clarity. I recommend investing in external speakers or a soundbar to enhance the audio experience.

In summary, if you prioritize a top-notch visual display and smart functionality, this Samsung TV is an excellent choice. Just be prepared to complement it with additional audio equipment for a more immersive sound experience."
