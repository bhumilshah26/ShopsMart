VB,üçé‚ù§Ô∏è,"For me, I was drawn to the MacBook Air M2 because of its sleek design and powerful performance. I was looking for a laptop that could handle my workload, which includes a lot of multitasking.
No overheating problem yet , just perfect."
Anirudh Thakur,Lives upto Apple standards,Another excellent product from Apple.
,Perfect for content creators,"This is a beautiful machine with good amount of power and I have not experienced any lags. It is a lightweight machine, makes no sound, battery is top-notch, bright enough to see under the sun, and smooth to navigate between tabs and windows. It is costly but you can recover what you spend in matter of months or a few years. I am not going back to any other brands at least for 4-5 years."
