Cheaters From Amazon,Frauds,I bought the product. It's defective. It's been only 4 days. Tried to claim replacement. But they are not processing it. I'm going to lodge a case against Amazon. Never buy products from Amazon. It's not as good as earlier.
Ayush Indapure,"Best Coding,office laptop","I liked the performance and especially the display of the MacBook air m2, you can almost run any highend software on this beast laptop(tested flutter,android studio and figma), Before buying this one I saw many YT videoâ€™s and almost every channel were saying donâ€™t buy the m2 model it is not worth the upgrade compare to the m1 model, But from my experience it is definitely worth it and the new SONAMA update makes it more efficient , GO FOR IT ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥"
,Worth the Price !!,
Ashley,Ridiculously overpriced,Not worth the price. 8 gb ram. Lol. 256 gb storage. Now a days more ram and storage is available in smartphones. That display size is an insult to consumer intelligence.
