Writing review after using 10 months..
This is my second time to by it again with a good deal..
The laptop compartment of this bag is really legit.
You will never disappoint If you buying this bag for laptop
It has an awesome safety feature for laptop...
Never seen any bag like this under 1000 budget...
Don't think much just click to buy It....

The bag has not capacity to bring all your stuff.
You can bring a laptop, tab , and about 5 books of 400 pages.. and some small accessories. i.e. It is only made for laptop user basically in office and for college student who brings there laptop in college.
And you can bring most weighty stuffs also, It has an awesome build quality...
Really it will never disappoint you..."
Tarkeshwar Lanjewar,nice bag,"good quality, worth of money, looking very üòä"
,Quality really good but no compartments.,I prefer the bag with lots of compartments to segregate my supplies. This bag has only one large compartment without separate slots for pens or anything.

vaishnav,"Initially had a negative experience, but turned out to be a really good slim laptop travel bag.","This bag is perfect for traveling with a laptop. Unfortunately, I initially received a defective, torn bag, but Amazon promptly replaced it within a week.
There's just enough space for a laptop, but not much room for additional clothes or items. It's ideal for carrying a laptop to college or work.
I can comfortably fit my 16-inch laptop, laptop charger, mobile charger, keyboard, mouse, notebook, and pen.
Despite carrying all these items, it's not tightly packed, but there isn't space for anything else. The laptop compartment is snug, ensuring the laptop stays secure without shaking."
Dinesh Kumar,Most affordable & best quality,More than a month used this bag as per my review it's a descent laptop bag at this price range. For traveling purpose you can carry 3 to 4 set of clothes with laptop in this bag. Overall I will give 4 star's.
