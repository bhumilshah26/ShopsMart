Rohit,Natural Sound experience,This product is very good in in sound quality and it produce natural sound which is very soothing for ear to listen any music and its audio quality for calling is also very good and when I listen any voice on calling then it is also very clear and it is better than any other wired headphone. No doubt it is costly but it is very best other than any headphone.
Vansh Manchanda,Sound Quality is perfect .,"Whether you use it for your laptop or any other system with 3.5 mm jack . It works well. Loved the sound , bass everything . It‚Äôs Apple . No doubt on the quality ."

vishnu,Everything is good except volume controls.,Everything is good. But Volume controls won't work non-apple devices.
Akhilesh,Original product > Good Quality > Worth the spend,"Received the product yesterday. Used it for a day. I was looking for a wired ear pod for office calls, usable both on laptop and phone. This proved worthwhile. However, there is no ANC in this. The voice control do not work on Android devices. But that wasn't my priority. But the output is too good. Overall a product to have if you have a similar requirement."
Dass,Nice wierd ear phone,Music and bass sounds are terrific
Emmy,Mic quality is not good,"I bought it specifically for good mic but its mic is normal, not good. But the sound quality is amazing. But many other companies in this price range offer excellent mic quality. So why not apple?"
ATHARV SHUKLA,Go for it,Apple is apple. It's similar to apple airpods in sound quality and mic quality is best.
Devki Nandan Mishra,Sound quality,Nice earphone..buy it without any worry..üëåüëå
Deon v,Good,The sound and call quality is good. But your ears will start to pain if you are planning to use it for long hours because of the no silicone tips design.
Vinit Joshi,1st out of box review,First out of box review feels good after initial use. Now need to see how it works over longer period of time.
Cust,Liked it,"A good find. I checked out various websites like croma, reliance but I could get it for a lower price in amazon. The quality is good. It has noise cancellation. The packing was intact."

sujeet,Volume controls won't work on android phone,Best quality sound and comfort the only thing that is bothering me is that volume controls wont work on android devices
,Sound quality is amazing,"A bridge between two earphones where we will tight the cable is broken. Even after 2 deliveries, it was the same. I felt a little disappointed over there. Other than that, the sound quality is amazing, and Apple should focus on the cable's durability as it is fragile.

Advantages:
1. Awesome Sound quality
2. easy to wear n use
3. Mic

disadvantages:
1. durability
2. Thin cable
3. pain in the ear for long hours of use."
