Prasanna Bhalerao,iPhone is the standard against which all smartphones are compared,"I purchased this phone for my wife. Last year I purchased iPhone X for my son who is currently in the UK. I own an iPad and iMac 27"". I am not going to buy an iPhone for myself - at least not yet. One of the main things that I don't like about Android phones is the crap (bloatware) that each maker puts in. Moto and Google Pixel come with pure stock Android. So those can be left out. So I wanted a good phone for my wife so that she could FaceTime with my son in the UK anytime.

What is there to say? So many have written about it. Since everyone writes all the positives, I will write some negatives. While there aren't too many, no product can be perfect:

1. Brings in all the junk from the old phone. If one is switching from Android to iPhone, the ""Move to iOS"" app on Android can help. However be sure to clean up your Android phone first else all junk (especially ""Good Morning"", ""Good day"" picture crap from WhatsApp photos). Be sure to clean the SMS inbox also, especially all those blocked and spam messages which may be hidden from the main view and we never know that exist.
2. WhatsApp cannot be synced. Yes, there are 3rd party apps but they are full of ad-crap and I can't trust them for security.
3. Difficulty in validating iMessage and FaceTime. I could not activate iMessage and FaceTime with my mobile number. I simply could not figure this out. This is the case with my Vodaphone SIM/Number in India. Only when I added my email to my Apple ID, the two apps started working. Even now, the mobile number is not verified.
4. I wish Apple provides dual SIM. Now dual SIM is almost a necessity. But as my wife does not use two SIMs, for her, it is fine.
5. Apple is providing USB-C to lightning cable. They should supply USB-A to lightning cable instead. 99% of the chargers have a USB-A output. I had to purchase a USB-A to USB-C mini adapter (‚Çπ180) for this, or someone may have to buy a cable of the type (good cables from Apple, Belkin, Anker cost ‚Çπ1100 and above). By far, this is my biggest grouse.
6. This is not the latest iPhone. The iPhone 13 was ‚Çπ73,000 and did not seem VFM. Even at ‚Çπ56,000 (‚Çπ55,900 to be exact), the iPhone12 may not be money best spent. This is one reason, why I haven't purchased an iPhone for myself all this while (I can afford to buy the latest one every year)."
RakhuNathan,Not Really worth the money,"I have been an android user for the past 8+ years. Recently was using iphone 6 for the past few months, liked it much and wanted to switch to ios. I did not want to regret, so i purchased the best in the market, going with iphone 12. Honestly, I dont feel its worthy. Perfomance wise, its good. A lot other phones like MI, 1+ everything gives us a very nice perfomance too. The A14 chip is just a tag line to sell the phone. Are we really going to process million instructions per second on a mobile phone? Defenitely not.

Battery, After charging it to 100% in the morning, I am hardly getting 1 full day with average use. My battery is almost 20% at the end of the day with a screentime of 4-4.3 hours[Update : With low power mode, it makes a 6 hour day, ending with 30%]. Camera quality is amazing in natural light. Yes, as specified it works so nice in night light, but please dont mistake night light as no-light. Front camera is still average. The same things i see in every other mid range android phones. I am still using JIO 4g. Not sure how this would work on 5g (must drain even faster)

Face detenction, the color of the phone, Water resistant and all stuffs are nice to have, fancy items. But not really convinced if this is all we get for 84k?

Fast charging - I bought a 20W charger from apple store for Rs.1900. I plug in when the battery is 20-25% and it takes 1.45 hours to reach 100%. If this is all about fast charging you are looking for, well and good. I never tried with magsafe, honestly. But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.

I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.

PROS : Camera & Perfomance
CONS : Battery and Cost"
Srikanth,All good,Liked
Anjan Roy,Best phone in budget,I bought it on big billion day sale 2022 @48000/- I have never seen this price ever again for me it was a good buy.
Karan,Awesome with less Battery Backup,"If you can increase your budget
Then please purchase Iphone 13
Because the battery is so less in upto This Iphone Models
Overall the product is awesome"
Placeholder,Beastü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©,"Hello there,
I am writing this review after 3-4 days of usage, Iphone 12 is a beast in terms of:-
Memory
Build quality
Camera
Processor
Display
Except battery there‚Äôs rumour going on that iPhone 12 battery is bad or worst, so i am here to clarify all your doubts,
iPhone battery will last easily a day but not more than that and here‚Äôs some condition that you should aware about
1. If you are using your phone on wifi than it will last a day easily without any problem.
2. If you are on 4g than it will not last a day for example, if you fully charged your phone at 8 am than it will last till 8 pm not more than that and this happen if you‚Äôre on 4g continuously otherwise it will last about 10 pm.
Here‚Äôs some tip you should do after buying iPhone 12, watch video on YouTube to know ‚ÄúHow to save battery on iPhone 12‚Äù this will help you increase your battery life as well battery health.
For my experience, i think you should go for this device without any second thoughts & those who don‚Äôt have any tech knowledge and thinking of buying this then I recommend you to go for android because iOS has complicate settings than android...you will regret after buying it.

Got original product Btw!!!!!"
Srideep,Good,Godd
Axc,Superb,"Absolutely love the phone , been using for about 2 years now"
Placeholder,Storage problem with 64gb,Never buy 64gb because more than half of storage iOS cover itself.
Piyush Kumar,Phone is great but iOS sucks,"First of all, I don't know why people here are leaving misleading reviews, I didn't feel any sort of heating issue or something like that, neither my phone is damaged nor it is refurbished. These sort of reviews are only making other people sceptical.

Now let's talk about the cell phone itself.
It is great, I love it. The reason why I gave 3 stars is because I have been an android user before this device and I am being honest right now :-

iOS sucks in terms of user experience, Android is easy to use and makes a lot of sense (believe me, I was a hardcore android user, I didn't only use it for playing games and making calls). In iOS I kinda feel like being constraint.

let me give you few example, which are quite obvious but still not in iOS:-
1. Notifications
- You can't reply through notifications.
- Notifications from a similar user/ sender do bundle, but you can only see the latest message (You can't just swipe down on notification to preview the messages)
- if you want to remove a particular notification then you have to swipe two times to the left. If you swiped right then it will open the message for you (lol).
- Notifications are so huge, sometimes it's really painful to scroll through all the notifications.

2. App library
- It has something called app library, they thought it'd be cool to make one but by giving their own flavor. They bundled things in their respective folder not like in android where each icon represent an app. You have to explicitly click on search(app library) to see all apps in the list view or to search an app. Just copy android, no one is slapping you in the face for that.

3. whatsapp
- Using whatsapp is really frustating sometimes.
- To send some media to a contact, there are three processes. Two times it will do preparing and then one time it will do the sending (finally). if you are sending some big media to someone then you can literally get a 15 min power nap and then grab a cup of coffee and drink it, still there might be chances that the iOS would be in one of the preparing process.
- Sometimes when you click on someone's profile then instead of opening the user's profile, whatsapp tends to scroll to the location from where that current day chats are starting (I think that is whatsapp's issue not iOS)
- You can't directly send any media as a document (preserving it's quality). There are steps to do that too.

The above points are few examples, I will keep updating them as per my experience.

I am not saying iOS is slow or the phone's hardware is bad, it's actually quite opposite of bad, it's fast and amazing.
I just hated the user experience domain of iOS. It really really sucks. iOS should bluntly copy the android things so that the HARDCORE IPHONE USERS will know what user experience they were missing."
Rajkumar,Battery Issue,Phone lagging
AJITESH S.,good product,doesnot need any remark :)
Good vegetable,How to decide between iPhone 11 and 12,"After thinking a lot, I decided to go ahead with iPhone 12. The original price is ‚Çπ 84900. After credit card discount(‚Çπ6000), old phone exchange(‚Çπ3450) and reward points money(‚Çπ4530) inclusion, I bought it for ‚Çπ70920. There‚Äôs also an additional 3000 discount on red and white variants but I couldn‚Äôt let go of blue

1. PRICE: Considering iPhone 11 would be supported by iOS for 4 years, based on the current price it‚Äôd cost 13k per year and iPhone 12 for 5 years would cost 14.9k(excluding exchange discount) per year. For me price gap for both phones didn‚Äôt seem to make a huge difference as IPhone 11 is already an year old and costing only a 2k less per year.

2: DISPLAY: I‚Äôve purchased iPhone 11 for my mom last year and been observing the display for some months. Compared to iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 display is far superior and has better pixel quality.

3: BEZELS: the bezels of iPhone 12 are much thinner and makes the phone look decent unlike in 11. Apart from this, the phone is incredibly light making it easy to hold it.

How to choose between 64/128gb:
If you‚Äôre not really tight on budget, I‚Äôd suggest to go for 128gb variant. I‚Äôve been using one plus for 1.5 years and storage occupied about 60gb. So it‚Äôd make good sense to check your current phone usage. Either way you can also opt for iCloud 50gb storage which would cost approximately the difference amount of 64 and 128 go for 5 years.

CONS:
1. Could have definitely included the charger for the price
2. If you‚Äôre an android user, migration would be little time consuming

Update: I‚Äôve uploaded a couple of pictures shot using automatic night mode. :)"
,Nice phone - Light weight phone,"Good phone..

I bought this for 69,800/- Now it is 54,800/-

Haha"
harish dewangan,A lovely phone,"Well, the quality of this phone is absolutely worth it. I have been using it for a year and it still works the same as new. Camera performance is near to near same as iPhone 13. Battery life is amazing. Plus it‚Äôs handy and light weight."
Sushant M.,Worth to buy,"After year I m review iPhone 12 cellphone, which i bought 1 year back. It‚Äôs working fine no issue, color is very good (blue color), sound quality and camera is very good no issue found. I bought 1800Rs changing adapter. But packing was not so safety, no bubble wrap nothing simply one iPhone box that it. Seller should maintain proper packaging. Overall about the phone it‚Äôs very good and reliable. 128GB storage is good."
Cyber Naskar,Worth the price,"I migrated to iOS after using Android for more than 8 years. I am a standard mobile user, I do not play games on my phone and neither do I keep browsing social media for ages. The only things that I use my phone are for calling, whatsapp, taking notes, some light photography and watching videos. The most heavily used activity on my phone is watching videos on youtube.

With all these activities being done, my weekly average screen on time is 2-3 hours. I am satisfied with the battery life. It has been around 3 months of usage and the battery capacity is still 100%. With heavy usage, the phone lasts 6 hours give or take a few minutes, and with medium usage this goes way higher.
The standby time is excellent on this device. I have had instances where I used my phone for a total of 2-3 hours but a single charge lasted more than 36 hours.

All in all, I can confidently say that I am very happy with the security features the phone offers and I am happy with my purchase."
Pravin Gaikwad,Fantastic iPhone,Shifted from android phone fully satisfied but have to charge battery every day otherwise it‚Äôs Apple üòÄWorth but higher value Apple should minimise cost of all iPhones and accessories üòÉ
Very Good Product üëç,Good,Good phone
rupinder,I miss my OnePlus 6,"Android v/s iOS

Pro Apple
1. Tons of privacy features and solid implementation. Every new app installed needs permission to send notifications.
And with a future update, facebook won't be able to track what you're doing in other apps outside of Facebook. This deserves an applaud.

2. Battery
The battery is amazing, giving more than 6 hours of screen on time. OnePlus can't touch this. If you bring this up with them, they'll distract you by saying it has fast charging.

3. Camera - photos are ok and decent BUT, DAMN, the video quality is amazing. Totally stabilized ready for uploads.

4. Build Quality - SOLID.

5. Continued updates for years and years. An android may last you 2-4 years, and the updated would be ""raam bharose"", but these new iphones especially will easily last 5 years minimum with no compromises on software and security upgrades.

6. Less features, but they work 10/10. Example, auto fill OTP option in keyboard works every single timein iPhone. In Android, if your keyboard is open already before the otp arrives, then this feature won't work. Half baked implementation.

Pro Android / Anti - iOS
1. Notifications. Notifications centre on iPhone SUCKS. I have missed email notifications regularly. Android does this so well.

2. Implementation of new app library feature sucks. This creates a very confusing situation. The way to solve this would be if the auto-folders in app library could be manually managed.

3. Screen Sizes and Notch - The Notch is a disgrace for iphones when the iphones have reached the level of punch hole displays. Hoping the next year's model can make it better.

4. No Truecaller in iPhone and no call recording. I can forgive the call recording considering the privacy first model, but truecaller is a pro to privacy.

5. CHEAP QUALITY OF CHARGING CABLE. For a luxury brand, this is a disgrace.

6. PRICE - Yes, iphones are expensive BUT, paying +10-15k for a phone available cheaper in Dubai / USA really pinches. Damn Taxes.

7. Yes iPhones run smoothly but don't think that these don't stutter. I face very light stutters now and then and I restart at least once a week whenever I encounter it.

I'll probably give this phone to my family member against their iPhone x since they're way too deep in ios ecosystem now."
Asutosh padhy,Absolutely loved the phone but price could have been bit cheaper,"I phone i must say having great optimization of software with hardware, more quality apps are available when compared to google, receiving a file is the only major pain i felt till now,
Battery backup is really good 2800 mAh in apple is almost like 5000mAh in android am not kidding, i have rog phone 3 it is 6000 mAh but at the end of the day the i phone has almost same % left, may be it's due to the less hz display.
Despite of having 60Hz display it feels good
And what can i say the speakers are loud and clear compared with rog 3.
45k should have been the right price for 64gb model but for 53k it's not a bad deal either, if you ask me spending 50k for an android is not worth since i phone has all hardware and software superiority.
No charger is a big let down by apple. And finally 64gb is good enough if you ask me as most of those having wifi connection can easily upgrade to i cloud paying just 75rs/Month and for the average 3 years of use the price will be still 2700rs in three year. For the 128gb i had to pay 8000rs more so still i am saving around 5300rs if i chose to use i cloud from the starting day.
No Finger print sensor , but it's ok the face id does it right but yes the finger print should be good. And for the notch it's ok. I phone 12 and 13 has virtually no difference so y to waste 20k more money buying the 13 just for the bit improvement of camera and brightness, hope you like my review üôÇ"
,Great in some cases,"This is my very first i phone and I‚Äôve been using it since last September. Overall performance is too good, especially the camera..but if you‚Äôre searching for a phone that lasts for more than 6 hours then go for those ‚Äòpro max‚Äô models‚Ä¶"
Ujjal Padhan,Phone not power on,Dear team kindly check the product delivered date and activated date bcz this phone is not out of warranty so kindly check and revert as soon as possible bcz phone is not working
,The best thing ever happened in my life..!!,"First let me tell u it's a real beauty and this my first phone which is a iPhone....I was really excited about it to come to me as fast as possible........and before that I used Android phones which was my mom's as I was a teenager ...So it's been 1 week It came...it's not a bid deal you know to go from Android to iPhone you know..In just one day I got accustomed to it.....let me tell you... that you can't download MP3 music in iPhone where In Android it's a easy peasy thing....which I knew after receiving iPhone.....which would be a real bother to music alcoholic people...in those count me too....and please go with 128 gb if you want to buy because from 128 gb, 17 gb have already used in iOS system....which would be a real problem to you if you guys buy 64 gb variant...The camera is is really good factor...my siri is lightly having problem..it's always like ""Something went wrong! Please try again ""..I know i would happen to solve this problem too : ) .......I bought iPhone as because it's beast in case of CAMERAS...and it went really good price in the Great Indian Festival Of Amazon.....
And Lastly but not least...
THANK YOU AMAZON FOR KEEPING MY REQUEST TO DELIVER THIS PRODUCT FASTER!!"
neeraj kumar,The best Iphone in the budget.,"IPhone 12 is probably the best option to start or enter into the ios ecosystem.Here are the advantages of iphone 12:
1.The best camera phone,photos are amazing nad the video quality is even more better.
2.The performance is just top notch.No complaints at all.
3.The IOS is best at everything.No lags at all or almost.
4.The display is just amazing.It could feel a bit small, if you are shifting from an android,but the display quality is great.

Here are a few disadvantages:
1.The battery will last a whole day only if you are a moderate to light user.
2.The file transfer to an android device is a big hassle.

Conclusion: It is a very good device if you don't play too much games or use camera all day, as the battery will not last.
For me it is the best."
Sanjib M.,"READ before BUY ! ""Iphone 12! Worth buying or not?""","From owner POV, It's completely different experience for me as I've come from a long line of android platform. But the UI is very attractive. I think it surpassed my expectations as a consumer. But as a rational thinker, 79k is a lot for a phone which carry a little amount of specs ships. I'm lucky that I have a Amazon business account, so getting a GST bill.

As per the limitations :

1. 60 Hz display (with the beautiful UI animations, it doesn't feel like one)
2. Google exceeds on Maps, contacts and AI capabilities.
3. Hefty price tag. (I mean! Wtf is this! 80k! Are you serious?)
4. Necessity of a 1900 INR charger (That too of 20W and without extra cable. Why?)
5. One sillicon case worth 4600 INR ( Sorry! My name's not Sanjib 'Ambani' ! Terrible joke! I know! I left my sarcasm capabilities at an Apple store for leverage.)

Advantages:

1. It's a flagship iPhone 12 with A14 bionic processor and it's best in the market.
2. The UI and the optimization (And I came from an Android background.)
3. Display (Can't find much difference if you're a Samsung flagship user.)
4. The design and in-hand feel.
5. The build quality, you can feel by holding it that it's premium.

Overall, I found it very attractive and worthy of the money spent. (Because I am telling my mind this only as justification for a 80k expenditure)

On a serious note, as coming from an Android background, if Samsung could launch a flagship with Snapdragon latest processor, I could think of buying that.
But iPhone 12 in 2020? its a technological wonder. It's very slim, premium and beautiful.
If you're comfortable to spend 80k, you should go for it for a wonderful experience."
,Nice,Buy
ANURAG a.,Honest review after 30-40 Days,"Switched to IOS for the first time, was really very excited to get the iphone 12.
Display is stunning but might feel small if ur switching from a 6.5inch android
Speakers are amazing they are loud, clear and have dolby effects.
Build quality is superb which is expected from apple
Face id might sound a bit concerning but its well integrated and works flawlessly.
Camera is simply superb for a 2020 phone the video quality is unmatched.
Haptics are flagship level.

Cons-
battery isnt that good and needs to be charged once a day at the least sometimes even 2 times.
no charger in box had to purchase 20w charger for 1.8k
provided cable doesnt feel very sturdy
IOS 16 is filled with bugs and degraded battery life compared to ios 15( at the time of review)
The network reception isnt that great (cellular) wifi is great"
Manjula,A Nice product with lot of restrictions,"iP12 feels premium, sturdy, has nice camera and quick gps maps response.

I am a Google Pixel 2 user since 4.5 years so I will mention where I like/dislike this phone over pixel-2.

1- iP 12 Feels premium
2- Gps map response is awesome
3- so many restrictions in user interface and controls, pixel is way better
4- both have awesome camera quality
5- pixel is more handy to use
6- Pixel response is a lot better in low signal areas
7- bluetooth range is awesome in iP12
8- typing and keyboard experience is better in pixel
9- Noise cancellation is much better in my 4.5yrs old Pixel-2 compared to iP
10- Last but not least, pixel's day to day usage experience is a lot easy and smooth as compared to lot of restrictions and complicated response of iP12.

So if your usage is simple and you want to have feeling of premium product, go for iP.

My next phone will be Pixel again.."
Abhishek,This is a very good phone. The seller is reliable.,"iPhone 12 is a good product. If you are not obsessed with the ‚Äòlatest and the best‚Äô type of phone, go for any apple phone on the list. I chose 12 because it is 5 G compliant. If you are a price watcher, this is perhaps the best time to buy this one. I bought my phone earlier this month, and the price has dropped by one thousand rupees since then! But I am happy with the phone. Apple phones are expensive, but once you use an iPhone, you may not wish to use any other phone. I have been using a 5S for ten years. Only recently I changed the battery. It still looks good and works fine. You may take a couple of days to get used to the new device. 128 prices have dropped, 64 prices have remained almost the same since early October. This seller is good. Initially I was a bit unsure about buying it online, but if you live in a small city even buying from an apple store is almost like online buying. Go for it. Too early to comment on battery life. For best results, keep your iPhone phone on low battery mode, except while charging."
B K Danta,Just Wow....,"I have been using iPhone SE 2020 since last year which has been a great experience for me. Now that I bought IPhone 12 it is also a great phone with so many features. But the best thing I have experienced is the camera quality. It is way much better than any other phone at this rate. I bought this phone in Great Indian Sale and bought only for 47 K which is also been a benefit for me. It's build quality is good and it is light weighted, lighter than Iphone SE 2020. The processor is fast but the battery back up is not up to the mark. It goes from 100 to 20 in a day use and I am not using it much so the battery is not that good. I also have to buy the 20w charger and it is really charging fast. When you are holding the phone it will make you feel premium. The phone hasn't lag since one month use. It will regularly get updates which is great. Other than battery backup there is nothing you will regret about the phone. Overall an iphone is and iphone. At least you will look rich."
Achintya Aviral,Great purchase!,"I used to use an Android phone till 2014 and wanted to switch to iOS, so the same year I bought iPhone 6, It was good to have an iOS device and the performance and the cameras but those were sufficient only until next year when 6s launched. Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but couldn't buy them somehow. I wasn't and I'm not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.
As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn't eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.
Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I'm quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.
When it comes to iPhone 12, it's a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I'm gonna used to of it.
I bought a 128 GB device as per my requirement and colour white because finger prints on back are not visible, compared to other darker colours.
INR 3000‚Çπ Discount on the colour white, plus 6000‚Çπ HDFC instant discount. Effective price 76000‚Çπ. Unfortunately Charging Brick isn't included and it coasted 1900‚Çπ more for 20W USB-C from Apple India website.
Overall it's a great device and satisfied purchase but overpriced for sure."
Lav,Nice,Apple is best product
,Great,I‚Äôm still using it and it‚Äôs in the best condition right now ..
Sunny Rathor,For first time iPhone Users,"When the iPhone 11 prices were announced, I was in a dilemma whether to go for the 11 or wait for 12. And since it was my first iPhone, I thought why not get the 12. The logic being: The phone will last for a couple of years (provided you don't drop it often), and if you are looking for a phone for a long time horizon, then go for the 12. This one with the better chip and the display will be able to handle the upcoming updates as well the apps which will get even more intensive in the future.
All technical specs are really good, display is an OLED one, even visible in extreme sunlight. Build quality is miles apart, my brother uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, and holding this one is way way out of the leagues of all the android phones. Processor and RAM are capable of even running multiple intensive applications, I had Adobe LightRoom, iMovie, and a couple of apps open, all to slide between them seamlessly. The trick here is that since apps are only made for a very few iPhones and iOS versions, these apps are hardware integrated, hence work better. A classic example is Instagram. Instagram does feel a bit more polished on the iPhone than android. FaceID even works when there's no light, so thats that. But it can't identify you with the mask, you're left to the PIN when you're in the outside.
The Battery: Yes it has a smaller battery, yes with intensive use it will run out in a day, but if you are a bit prudent with it, it'll definitely last for more than a day. I use 4G in between, outdoor photography a bit, editing, email, Apple Music, Youtube, WhatsApp and Instagram. By the end of the day (7:00 PM) , I usually have 40 percent remaining.

So yes, its an iPhone and yes its really something nice to hold and use daily."
