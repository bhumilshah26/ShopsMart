Ajith,Cheap and Best,"For people with cheap and best mindset, this is a must buy model
Pros:
*Best configuration at best price
*can add another 16GB Ram (8+16)
Cons:
Build quality is very bad and looks flimsy. Itâ€™s a plain plastic. Once dropped, will break easily"
Technoedge Solutions,Very very 3 rd class service donâ€™t not buy,"Ordered on 12th Jan 2024 I got the laptop on 13th jan 2024,
I was not at home I have come home by 9:00 pm
Opened the laptop and the this screen has come canâ€™t operate since 3 days
Amazon customer support says that the Lenovo brand will first inspect then they will decide that it will replace or repair
Refund will be last options. Since the 13 jan no one is came from the Lenovo brand to inspect the laptop
This is not good service by Amazon and Lenovo"
