Armaan,One of the best in category especially for beginners,"So first of all I wanna say I'm writing this review after a use of almost a month and this will be a long but so beneficial for everyone.

So far I'm happy with the product as I realised that this is not a top level gaming like Asus tuf but actually its far better than Asus Tuf Gaming or other gaming laptops in this price range because this purpose is actually for people who don't do much of gaming and do other tasks, though even if you do so play whatever you want it will give you 60 fps in forza horizon 5 at 720p so the heaviest game is going smooth and so on for hours probably we can say its actually for gaming purpose with a look of non gaming laptops so some may find it fascinating and some may not because if you're a student so more likely people will surely mock you if they see using gaming laptop even if you don't do any gaming and study only but we know relatives,, let's get back to topic so as per now its clear that performance is top notch and now it comes on video playback like what is the highest quality you can watch videos on YouTube so first of all to do that I would like to inform that you must first do some setups like turning on GPU and then doing other settings like always optimize for quality and performance and you also have to do it for Forza Horizon 5 if you wants 60fps in 720p otherwise if its turned off then you'll get upset so must turn on GPU as its off by default so turn it on then enjoy so after turning on you are actually able to play 8K videos on YouTube without any lag so that's such an amazing thing because people sometimes are confused regarding will it give you 4K quality or not and here it's giving you 8K quality on YouTube but it is a thing to be noted like most of the content of YouTube is actually 1080p content especially all series and movies so obviously this 8K video streaming is good but not a reason for one should buy this so what's the reason?? Absolutely the performance which is outstanding though that doesn't mean we should ignore this 8K superiority as this shows the capability of this amazing tech and the graphic card RTX2050 have good fans so that's also good for keeping it little cool so not much heating problem and build quality is amazing and due to being aluminium while plugged in you may feel some slight shocks which is like a vibration so don't be worried at all its just ok as its back cover is of aluminium so don't Worry of it as no big shocks it just feels like a vibration so don't worry next thing is the battery backup after you turn it on to the performance mode then battery last upto almost 3 hours on slight usage if you do gaming you can see how fast it drains so don't do gaming while its not plugged in so overall this is all good and it may look suspicious as why there ain't any cons in this laptop so don't worry here are CONS:

First of all and always note that this laptop is not for gaming if you do gaming then absolutely its not for you not at all

It doesn't come with MS office so those who use ms office a lot so please stay away from this because you'll have to pay extra money for MS office but the question does it worth it to purchase ms office? So the answer is depends upon how you wanna use like slight gaming, multimedia etc. Then ofcourse this is worth it and if not then no don't go for it

No free features 😭 you gotta buy everything so man!! That can make it costly if you use Adobe, MS office, and any other paid subscription app because no matter what just pay!! So again does it worth to be pay so much after purchasing it so that depends on you because you know what you want so here in this case you have to check though it works best and overall performance is good but does it require all that thing well upto you!!

Perhaps for people who do other things especially study and believe this is actually for students because students do slight gaming and other things so for students nothing is better than this though profesinalist can also use because I can say its worth it as I've used because its very easy to use and everything so clean so just now upto you

I just hope this long review could help someone"
ace rider,Dont buy for Gaming. Only good for video editing or browsing.,"Acer Aspire 5 cons: 1) Not that fast
2) Very low speaker sound
3) Games run on 35-40 fps max thats all you get
4) Nvidia Graphic card is only 15watts
5) No usb type c slot
6) No DVD writer ( you dont need it in 2023)
7) Cannot add normal SSD or HDD
8) Very high power consumption
9) 4GB graphics memory insufficient to run even 2012 games (EG: GTA5 needs 6gb atleast for good qualilty., rest of the games post 2023 need atleast 12 GB graphics memory)
10) Insufficient cooling vents. Only one vent on the right top of the laptop below the screen.
11) Gets very hot not suitable to place on lap or it will burn your skin.

Pros: 1) Decent Screen quality and size
2) 3 usb slots( 2 on left and one on right) + Thunderbolt slot +lan cable slot + HDMI slot + 3.5mm headphone jack included
3) Decent for video and audio editing
4) Not made for hardcore gamers or graphic editing
5) Battery is 1.3 hours backup
6) HD webcam included
7) Mouse trackpad is good and it has fingerprint reader on the left of trackpad
8) Wifi 6E (Removable adapter inside the laptop)
9) 256GB NVME SSD included. ( one additional slot for NVME ssd)
10) 12th gen intel i5 cpu very good. 12 core cpu.
11) 4 GB graphics memory NVIDIA with cuda cores.
12) 16 Gb ram included very fast
13) Backlight keyboard only white light
14) Drivers readily available online on intel and Acer websites
15) Supports bluetooth mics headphones all for online meetings even usb heaphones supported. But bluetooth mic should be of good quality.
16) Runs hot during gaming.
17) Medium weight laptop and a bit thick.
18) Aluminium frame. Does leak a bit of current on the top of laptop when you touch it. It can be solved with proper earthing wire.
19) Suggested to buy another keyboard and mouse so that you dont damage its keyboard inbuilt.
20) Supports windows 11 home. Windows 11 pro can be bought on microsoft store if you want encryption of drives.(Bitlocker)
21) 1080p resolution lcd screen.

I think there are better laptops out there in this price range. I only bought this laptop for wifi 6E and backlight keyboard. Better get a touch screen LED type for battery savings and dont pay for windows 11 pro. If possible get a DOS laptop and purchase windows 10 home.

For gaming i wont recommend, it only has 4gb ddr4 graphics memory which is too low in todays standards.

The bios does not have fan speed or voltage control options.

Booting speed is good. Boots under 5 seconds."
USER,Value for Money,"The design is very good. Screen quality is awesome. Backlit keyboard looks so beautiful. Battery backup is around 4 hrs in normal usage. Speaker volume is low. Have played some games GTA V etc, no problem at all."
Tanveer,Improvement requires,"Attention to anyone considering buying this laptop! Let me recount my experience: I purchased an Acer laptop and used it for about a month without any issues. However, it started overheating and the battery was draining rapidly. On November 18, 2023, the laptop abruptly shut down. I contacted the service center immediately, and on November 21, an engineer came to inspect the laptop. They identified a damaged motherboard and said it needed replacement, estimating a 2 to 3-day wait. After returning on November 28 with a new motherboard, they attempted to install it, but the laptop failed to start. The engineer suspected another issue with the replacement motherboard, necessitating another service request and an additional 3 to 4-day wait. As of December 5, the laptop remains unrepaired. This experience has been frustrating, considering the purpose for which I bought the laptop. I'm sharing this to shed light on the situation for everyone's awareness.""
HOW MUCH TIME I WASTE PLEASE DO NOT NEED TO ANYBODY ELSE BE CAREFUL"
,Value for money,"It's value for money. CPU is low-power series within i5 (1240p). As a result, it doesn't perform as snappily as 12400h, which consumes far more power, and will deplete your battery faster. But overall, it's acceptable, it won't blow you away.
The GPU is the only ampere class gpu in the 2000 series, and performs decently. Almost mid-range performance.
RAM is DDR4. If you really have the budget, go for a model with DDR5 and higher clock (4800 MHz) RAM. These days, the bottleneck in performance is at the RAM level.
But for Rs 46k (after offers) in Diwali 2023, this one was the cheapest laptop with a discrete GPU and a 12th or 13th Gen processor."
sreej,"Good laptop with perfomance, could have been better.","Excellent value for money purchase with a powerful chipset, decent battery life, good display for a regular use. Good keyboard and trackpad. All the latest wireless conectivity features are included. Good for casual gaming too. But where it falls short is in the sound department, that to falls short by a lightyear. Speakers are absolutely pathetic with no loudnes no bass no nothing. But i dont use the laptop speakers much for anything. So not much of an issue for me. Buit quality is satisfactory. If you are on a budget and want a powerful laptop with some compromises, go for it without thinking much. If you can strech your budget a little bit more, you can easily find much better options from well reputed brands."
Susheem Ram,Average Product,"I purchased this laptop for Rs. 46,240 during the 2023 Great Indian Festival Sale. From my perspective, here are the pros and cons:

Pros:

1. Inclusion of an i5 processor within this price range.
2. The RTX-2050 provides excellent value for money.
3. It's a lightweight laptop.
4. Impressive overall performance.

Cons:

1. The build quality is primarily plastic.
2. The keyboard feedback is subpar.
3. Lack of a Type-C charger.
4. Sound quality is unsatisfactory.
5. The label and printed information on the laptop battery appear different, raising suspicions of whether the product may be refurbished."
Densingh,Good product,As of now working fine
Prasad Y,Average and but service is good,"Ok ok .my one i bought one its battery stopped working within 2 days, then i ordered it again thats mother board stopped working within 12 days,and i couldn't return it as amazon hives only 7 days replacement,so finally after months of requesting and calling, i decided to get it repaired.that they did very fast and currently its working well."
Krishna dwivedi,Good Product,This is a good laptop. Worth to buy. For gaming this is not recommended. And battery drain issue is a negative.. Worth to buy.. I purchased this for around 44 thousand
Joshvasingh,Aspire5,Good product
Sachin,good laptop for working and moderate gaming .,"the build quality is not up to the mark. the audio system is good, the display was wonderful. the user experience was very smooth and fluently working. it good for the study and office purpose it is good for developing also. it is sutiable for gamming also"
Vishnu Vardhan Kumar,Good laptop,Best for gaming and entertainment 😁
,"Great laptop, Average battery, Low sound output","The laptop itself is great. The screen quality is good too. there are some problems to address . As the sound is very low, you would most definitely need a external speaker or headphones if you wanna experience some good media. The battery is average for this price range . Should not expect any more though. It lasted about 4.5 hours for me in normal usage as i haven't tried any games yet. Games should not be played in battery mode anyways(sould be plugged in). Although there is one more concern to address (i don't know if it is a problem with my laptop or every other acer aspire 5 does this) that is it gives off a tingling effect on the metal lid while charging. That might be an issue with my power outlet though. If anyone else experiences the same , can you provide me with a solution. It's not been many days since i bought it so i might edit my review after a month or two."
Subir Debnath,Laptop,Good ..friendly used
Good and resonable price..i like it very much,Decent performance but bad battery backup,"If you are into light gaming and simple hd editing then definitely you can buy this laptop.
The performance is decent , not too good nor too bad.
The battery drains within 4 hours in regular usage and during gameplay it gives just 2 hours.
If you use it at home it's good for office and other usess I don't recommend"
Placeholder,Dont buy for Gaming !!! 8 Months usage Review,"This lapotp is being advertised as a gaming laptop these days. I'd say it's not so, this is a Powerful Thin and Light laptop. Professionals go for it, Gamers AVOID IT!

Okay why's that so, lemme explain the Cons of this for gaming: (I've upgraded my laptop to 16GB Gskill + 1.5TBs of SSD)

TLDR: CPU THROTTLES AROUND 12-15W which drops the GPU Usage to 30-40% for any game due to CPU Bottleneck! Acer BIOS Power limits the CPU to 12W.

1. The laptop Power adaptor is 90W, with dGPU rtx 2050 going upto 35W alone. This is a MaxQ version of the RTX 2050 which comes in newer budget gaming laptops.
2. The GPU is not the issue for gaming here! Yes despite being 35W counterpart it's quite powerful as it's same Ampere based GPU 3050. RTX 3050 + 64Bit = RTX 2050.
The real issue lie within the CPU power throttling!
3. i5-1240P despite being much powerful CPU, goes upto 45W on inital full load giving awesome performance due to Intel SpeedStep technology, but short after few 10s seconds the CPU throttles around 12-15W TDP ONLY! THIS CAUSES THE CPU TO STUCK ONLY UPTO 0.9-1.1Ghz on full load! This makes any game shutter like hell after just few minutes of the gameplay!
4. Thermals ain't a issue for performance! The Laptop has 2 fans which goes upto 6250RPM alone. I thought maybe due to temperature the CPU starts throttling but no even at 60°C temprature (tested with 5Fan cooling pads) the CPU is stuck for the same load. Investing it further in XTU, It's the Acer BIOS Power limit which can't be changed unless acer decides to do something for an Bios update.

Coming to the positive part, as i brought it for mostly work purposes apart my office laptop (I'm a Developer) these features are hard to find in any laptop in the segment:

1. 12Th gen CPU 12/16 + 4GB RTX 2050. This ensures Coding workload on multiple IDEs, Running Android Emulator is easy!
2. Latest Technologies which make it super portable: Thunderbolt 4 coming with Power delivery, Now i charge this and my office laptop with same Type C 60W PD charger of my phone. So You can just take a normal 60W PD charger!
3. Wifi 6E is a cheery on top!
4. One extra Nvme slot is a plus point!

Overall:

4.5/5 : Thin and Light portable laptop.
1.5/5: Gaming Laptop."
Kshitij,Worth the cost,"I bought this laptop in August 2023.
I am very happy with the purchase. I am an Embedded SW Developer, and I do need to run IDEs and other software which utilize good amount of processor and RAM. This laptop comes with a very powerful processor and it is sufficient for my usage. I have also ran software like Adobe PhotoShop, etc. and the CPU/GPU handles it perfectly.
This laptop is thin and light, even though it comes with a graphics card, which is cherry on the cake. I am not a heavy gamer, I do play Valorant and PUBG occasionally and the performance of the laptop is pretty good.

There are some CONS:
1. Not so good battery backup. It hardly lasts for 2-3 hours.
2. The camera cover is not available.
3. Sound quality is not-so-good.

I knew these cons of the laptop before purchasing, and I was ready to compromise. Overall this is a great laptop as it suits my needs and budget. You can buy it if you are into Graphics development/SW Development and a lite gamer. This laptop is worth the money."
,good,good in this price range
Nachiketa Thakur,Performance and battery,"I am using after 1 months better performance and battery min 3-4 hrs backup and 1 issue I connected the internet his air paseed crack sound.

Performance:-4.5/5
Sound:-3/5
Display:-4/5
Battery:-4/5"
"Large size, unfit to my keyboard",Microsoft is not free,"Play Video
Ms office software is not free
It costs upto 5000₹ per year for single person use"
,Display and design is bad,"There is a heat vent faced directly towards laptop screen which causes the screen to heat up... Even during gaming (tried sleeping dogs, gta V) there is a small screen flickering. The performance is good tho (gta V ran on 1080p very high graphic settings at 50+ fps, sleeping dogs ran at 1080p high graphic settings at 60 fps)"
Charan satya dev,Easy to use,"The Acer Aspire 5 gaming laptop offers a decent balance of performance and affordability. Its dedicated GPU provides satisfactory gaming experiences for mid-range titles. The overall build is sturdy, but battery life might not be a strong suit during extended gaming sessions. Consider it if you're on a budget and prioritize gaming performance without the frills."
,Very Good Purchase in this price range,It is a very good and powerful laptop with decent support for gaming.
Nikku,Bent of laptop screen more apperant.. though it is usual for any laptop,"1. Laptop screen when seen from side it shows like strongly bent.. it is usual, but in this case it is so apperant
2. It is not wifi 6e, only WIFI 6 standard
3. weight is bit high
4. Battery is tooooooo poor, does not last long
5. heat is towards screen as vents exists there.. not sure if that is a problem in future

else rest all are good.. works like charm

Also, seeing no lights for the space bar.."
Shri Prasada,Value for money! 👍,"Really good laptop. Good for every use. Only slight heating even when working at maximum extent.
● Pros
- Medium level Gaming
- Medium level Editing (video, photo)
- Good for Entertainment use
- Best for study purposes etc..

● CONS :
- Battery backup is poor, better to use while charging
- The keyboard feels a little low quality but gets the job done ✔️
- Speakers sound quality is good, but less loud"
Raja Nagendra Kumar,Good but false advertising,"The laptop is good but the product page says wifi 6E ,i.e intel chip but i received mtk wifi 6 variant"
,"SOUND , MS OFFICE , Battery and Anti virus subscription","*There is no Ms office,anti virus subscription.
*Especially I am very dissatisfied about SOUND quality which is veryyyyy poor
*The provided hinge mayy damage in future aspects
*Battery back up is little bit poor"
Aswin,ok product.,ok for the price but not up to the mark.
,Performance is good but less battery backup,"The performance of the laptop is good in 16gb version. But it legs in battery performance. After using two months, the batter backup is just 2 hours maximum on continuous usage. It is good for programming & coding, day to day usage, I can't say about the gamming performance as I don't play. If you want to use for graphics designing then you should prefer more powerful cpu than this one. After using 2 months I can say, upto heavy coding & programming it is good beyond it you should prefer other"
Mr. ABHAY SARVADNYA,Value for money,In this budget best buy.. value for money!
vinayakan c g,Good,"Weight is bit more, but the configuration is good. Drawback felt is the heat vent is just below the monitor when we using so not sure the ventilations is proper. Also the battery backup is very low. After few month itself it's reduced to 45 min. After 1.5year it's been now 15min backup"
rj speed,Lowest cost upper mid range pc in segment,"Cpu 12th gen i5 with 12 core (8efficient+4high perf)
Nvidia rtx series gddr6 4gb gpu perfect mid ranger
Storage is Western digitals brand fitted
Panasonic 3cell 50whr battery
Wifi and bt is Intel
Audio is realtek
Ethernet is Atheros branded.
Thunderbolt 4 type USB c 3.2 generation 4
Usb 3.2 pen drive if connected it can transfer upto 1gb/s copy speed. I tested.
Windows 11 optimum speed and battery balanced as compared to 10. So this pc is good
I bought for 47k,
Adapter 90w medium speed charging...0-100 in 1hour 20mins around..battery is good capacity unlike other brands don't give 50ah, others have 30-40 only
First I compared with Lenovo, it has 11th gen only cpu, also gpu nvidia GTX only. So this pc same price they provide...so this acer is very discounted price brand.

Only negative is touch pad not soo fast..it slow..but works...better use external mouse...perfect...

Every laptop has pros and cons.. this laptop touch pad little low sensitivity...little over heat only..because gpu is there when we play games...
If you are expert go for this GPU pc, otherwise go for non GPU pc"
,OK but not best,"Here are some of the cons of the Acer Aspire 5 Gaming Laptop:

1. The laptop's screen is very dull. The colors aren't very bright, and the picture isn't as clear from all angles.
2. The speakers aren't great either. The sound is kind of muffled and isn't very loud. It's not ideal for watching movies or playing games.

Only buy it if you got it around 45-46k during sale."
Placeholder,Most fantastic product 👌,Great product 👌
,General product,"I am a linux guy, so after I brought this laptop (16GB, single stick) spending 53k on festive season, simply installed Debian on new partition. Found that, hardware is so new that the os can't find it.

If you are an average user and willing to use linux you can try linux mint which works perfectly including its graphics card. No issue at all.

I knew that the battery backup will not be much more so I am not going to complain here - getting approx 3 hours plus by browsing and coding (not compiling)

Good: speed: performance is super. very fast and responsive.

Problem 1: keyboard color: on daylight if you don't look the keyboard vertically which you wont - will not be able to read letters written in keys. - very bad. I have enabled keyboard light always on from bios. typing is not so good or bad.

Problem 2: touchpad: in windows and linux both - touchpad lags for couple of seconds very now and then. Trust me - this is not a user created issue. It might be the touchpad hardware issue (not Acer's fault) or software (firmware / kernel) issue presents in Windows and Linux both. Its been more than a year now (talking about touchpad hardware, not the laptop).

Purchase 1: 1TB GEN3 M.2 SSD and installed on second slot. Works fine.

Purchase 2: Another 16GB RAM and installed, now total having 32GB RAM.

Tips: In bios if you cant see any option to change touchapd driver, for example ps/2 or advance mode - press ""ctrl + s"" and few new options will be available for that session."

Kumar,Battery backup is low,Every thing is fine but battery backup is very low
Puneet C.,HONEST REVIEW!!!,"1. It should not be considered as gaming laptop at all. Providing the graphic card 2050 doesn't allow you to do proper gaming, basic gaming can be done.
2. Normal other office work can be done smoothly no issues with that.
3. Display is good.
4. Sound from the speaker is very low. So consider this as another negative feature.

Overall, what I can is it shouldn't be titled as a gaming laptop."
Aizad Khursheed,Good one,"Good performance, good battery back up but the audio output of speaker is very low."
Placeholder,Sound quality is not satisfied,"Low sound quality ,but other than that it's wowwwww for the beginners"
Amazon Customer,Best product at this price range,"Screen quality is good I like screen resolution.
Keyboard is ok.
Trackpad and finger unlock response is very good.
Overall performance is good for multi tasking virtual machine using.
Top metallic cover colour is attractive.

Cons
Camera shutter missing
Battery backup is not much better.

Conclusion
If you are looking a product to do multitasking then it is best product, not for pro gaming.

And last thing at this price range with this specs you can't get from others"
Vishu,Powerful processor with Underpowered Battery .!!,"This acer laptop gives good performance without any doubt. For light works, this much weighing laptop is not necessary. This much performance is also not necessary. Go for 14"" ones. I expect acer to manufacture this same laptop with 13-14"" screen to get good battery backup. 15.6"" laptops drain so much battery for no reason. Also, Windows has become battery hungry.

Ratings:
Battery = 3/5
Screen = 3/5
Processor = 4/5
Ready from Boot = 4/5
Sound = 2/5
Weight = 3/5

Pros:
1. Good processor i5-1240p
2. Thunderbolt port
3. Typing is good. Got Number pad too.
4. Fast charging
5. Sound Quality is good
6. Brightness is good
7. No fan sound. It is quiet, surprisingly (for me .!!)
5. Received a sealed piece (thanks to amazon)

Cons:
1. Low sound output. You should put the laptop on a table or pad to get reasonable sound output.
2. Low battery backup for heavy works, just 2-3 hrs or even less. Android Studio works just for 2 hrs only. You can get away with 5hrs with light works for sure.
3. Display Contrast is not good.
4. Key colors are really bad. It is very difficult to spot keys suddenly. If you don't know typing, it wastes lot of time. Black color is the preferred one. I want to see the engineer who designed it :("
Vishruth,Bad speaker but overall not value for money,Over all laptop might just pass with screen and battery. Speaker Sound is very bad. Even mobiles are louder these days. I would not recommend this laptop to anyone . Laptop was only exchangeable else would have returned it
sanjeev singh,Nice Laptop but GPU is really underpowered.,"Screen quality is good. I prefer watching some of the shows on my laptop.

Performance is good enough. Never faced any lags with VS Code and multiple tabs open in Firefox.

Backup could last anywhere between 3-5 hrs. If you have wi-fi on then the battery drains much faster. Screen brightness also affects battery backup.

GPU is kind of disappointed because it is actually weaker than the GTX 1650 (the 50 watt varient). Rtx 2050 is only of 35 watts and hence performs worse that GTX 1650.

Ram is in dual channel. Both slots are occupied.

This laptop also has a problem with electric leakage. The upper corners of lid while charging give out electric shocks. It has only happened twice in two months but now I have to be wary of that.

Touchpad is nice I have always liked gestures that come with it. It did felt very rough at first but was smooth after 2-3 days.

Camera is on par with what you expect in a laptop. You will be able to recognise yourself and that is enough.

To conclude, everything is about alright except the GPU. If only it were of 50 watts this would have been a perfect laptop. It's not bad but just disappointing."
,Is the product both genuine and properly sealed,"Upon receiving my order, I was initially uncertain about whether the product would be open-box or perfectly sealed. However, to my satisfaction, the item arrived with two seals intact, indicating its freshness as it was manufactured in July. Furthermore, upon registering the warranty, I discovered that the product was shipped directly from Acer through Appario Retail Pvt Ltd. This reassures me that I've purchased from a reputable seller providing genuine products."
