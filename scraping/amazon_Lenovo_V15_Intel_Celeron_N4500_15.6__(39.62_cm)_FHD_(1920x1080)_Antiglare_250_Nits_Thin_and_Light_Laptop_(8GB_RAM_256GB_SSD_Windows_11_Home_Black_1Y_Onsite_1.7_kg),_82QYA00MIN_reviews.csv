,Good laptop,Very nice
suhas,Very slow working,Laptop have no any MS office inbilt and very slow working many time off hone ke baad on he nahi hota hai...
Siddharth Kumar,Amazing laptop in budget,Must buy it... amazing fantastic ever ever
parivesh tiwari,"Good value laptop, but very slow","Even with an SSD which boots quickly into Windows, the cpu is just too weak to handle basic browsing and YouTube. Adequate for basic tasks, but prepare for painfully slow browsing with multiple tabs on Chrome. God forbid if you open YouTube, the screen and colors are just dull and too washed out."
Praveen G Prakash,Everything Is Awesome,Amazing Performance
,not a bad product windows not include (install),"you have to pay 885 in the service center of lenovo for windows 11 in my product it does not come and I have to conform it from lenovo customer care.
now I have been using it for like 3 5 days.
First it's a 25000 laptop these days you don't get a good tablet in this price range so I am going to give my opinion based on it
a great product if you just want to do a normal workload like ms work or chrome multitasking on YouTube it plays 2160 60 fps but screen is normal not so colourful vibrant etc but still the price so its a great product heating problem yes there is but room temperature is there and you can add a cool pad so normal disk space is less but upgradable sometime slow but still good conclusion it's a very good product I get a new one yes I seen some videos where there a lre two sticker of lenovo I asked engineer they say we have to check the product first then we will let it go to customer so not a big deal but check still
so if you want a laptop 15.6 screen at this range you are good with some lag go for it it's not a bad product at all lenovo service center is also wonderful people but don't c9mplain for screen is not good I am not been able to play gta 5ü§£ü§£ it's just not for it"
The Sound & Battery Backup Is Truly Amazing.This Is The Product You Will Never Regret After Buying.,Awesome,Good
,Not compatible,"Cannot play games with not so high graphic card requirements. Considering this, Price is set to be very high"
anmol,Budget friendly,"Laptop is budget friendly but it has little bit more heating problem and battery backup is also below 5 hours and if you will use it with full brightness you will fill that the battery backup becoming more less....
But in this range it would be useful for people who want to do normal work like accounting, normal coding and and can watch movie but during movie you will feel that battery backup should have been more..."
Placeholder,User manual missing,"It is very disappointing to see that user manual was missing in the box. User manual is an important document, which is to be always sent along with the equipment. Also as per your order details , it has to be provided.
I am yet to test the item . After seeing all the features I will give my feedback.
Please do the needful."

Good product. Just it gets heated early nowadays and the picture quality is not that according to the expectations and the camera is very low in quality ‚òπÔ∏èüôÇ,Okay ‚úÖ,The camera is very disappointing
Steffy Michael,A fake sticker on top of one that was already cut. High chances of the product being misused.,"Day 3 - pros - lightweight, decent size, good camera, okay sound quality.
Cons - gets heated very quick, it's slow compared to day one. The tag was torn. Very suspicious. Can't believe Amazon has reached this stage, where there is no quality check and they give people trash."
,Lenovo laptop,I liked everything except battery. Its getting discharged very fast even after I use for half an hour.
Aravinda,Original Received product is different than in picture mentioned.,"Laptop is nice, but it's not the same colour product will receive, and may be u can receive used, so check carefully."
