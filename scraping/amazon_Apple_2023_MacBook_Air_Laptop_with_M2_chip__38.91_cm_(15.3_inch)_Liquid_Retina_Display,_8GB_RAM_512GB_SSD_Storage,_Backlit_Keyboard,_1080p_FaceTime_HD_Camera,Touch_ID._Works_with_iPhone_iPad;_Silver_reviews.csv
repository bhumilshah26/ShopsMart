Shabbir,First MacBook,"My experience so far has been mostly great, but also bit not so in few cases. While I'm an iOS user for almost 10years, this is the first Mac I've ever laid hands on. The design and feel compared with other Laptops that I've used is beyond description. Clearly even before the Mac starts, one can just admire the look and feel. The screen quality is great. The trackpad works differently (but nicely) compared to a Windows laptop. Ofcourse one has to get used to few Mac specific keys, but in no time you can get started.
Because of the 15"" screen, working with multiple windows is easier. Audio quality is good, and camera is also great.
One experience that I have not enjoyed so much is the compatibility with McAfee products on Venture 13.5.1. Since I've bought a 3yrs licensce to protect my Mac, but due to some compatibility issue that McAfee is busy to fix for almost a week, I'm cnot using the Mac regularly."
Bhavya Doshi,Macbook air 15 inch,"i know u must be wondering which adapter is been given in box ,it is 35 watt with dual type c , but the mac charges pretty fast with that too and lasts longer , so if you get mac at lower price than market than surely buy it from here ! otherwise it is an awesome machine looks great , screen is great , sound is great , camera is great and it syncs with iphone , iwatch and airpods"
Abhi P,Experience is par to none,"Overall, happy with the purchase."
Ishan d.,Got a broken display and amazon refused to exchange it within the period,"It was by far the worst experience by amazon , i got it with a broken display , I immediately contacted amazon where to my horror they asked me to get a written service denial letter from apple‚Äôs service centre, the people at apple were very cooperative so they gave a written letter with their stamp on it, amazon denied it even after that!! It was clear by then that amazon is not going to take it back , the people at apple‚Äôs service centre were increasingly cooperative , they first insisted to put a new display but since the display was unavailable, they made it a CRU(customer return unit) and i got money back from APPLE , then i ordered a macbook pro from FLIPKART the best purchase at a good price"
Rohan Kotecha,Beast that is long to last,"Apple Macbooks are really built to last. Unlike any other brand that you may consider, these laptops are a GEM when is comes to regular computing & browsing. I am not sure, how they perform in Gaming & other creative stuff, but for regular office usage, this is the most wonderful equipment possible."
Swamy,Apple is Apple,"Excellent. Had MacBook Pro 2015 Retina. Nothing wrong with my old Mac. But this 15.3"" is really very impressive. The display and M2 performance is superb. For my office work 256GB is quite sufficient. But I should have gone for 512GB storage since my Insta 360 recoding files occupy quite a large space."
Amazon Customer,Good laptop,"I have been using Max book air 2014 version. It lasted for almost 8 years. I had to upgrade as my earlier MacBook had only 4gb ram and was not upgradable.

M2 with 8gb ram is like any windows laptop with 32gb Ram.
Worth every penny"
,Works like a charm,"Big screen all the way. got it for 1.28l. It's worth my ""investment"". Using it for coding and media consumption and battery im getting more than 12 hours. Heat issues are minimal especially when using apps which are not optimised for this silicon chip. But I could throw anything at it and it takes like a pro"
Anu,Quality,Quality product

Avi jain,Best laptop ever,This laptop is value of money and this the best performance laptop in world I think is the greatest laptop
Satyendra Dubey,they are offering less storage just to torcher customers so next time we buy their costly devices.,"Once used apple- no one would like with any other thing/brands, n they are offering less storage just to torcher customers so next time we buy their costly devices."
Dharmendra Rai,A worthy Air Upgrade,"In a world of silly incremental upgrades here is one that hits the mark . Bigger screen, getter audio , more battery time . Nothing airy fairy about it . The start button should have been left embedded on the key pad rather than as a separate key . The key on off switch makes it difficult to clean the laptop when the battery is not 100 % drained . A design flaw probably touted as an improvement that Steven would have have baulked at"
,Original product,"Good product of course, Apple is reputed and trustworthy, packaging and delivery was great , hence no complaints on the product üëç"
Xxx,Light weight and most powerful sound quality and length increase before other MacBooks,"This is product MacBook is very nice and like me for personal experience and value of money product so I sujjes to buy this laptop and your experience will be most better trust me
Therefore let me try once"
Amazon Customer,There‚Äôs no 16 gb ram variant on Amazon.,It‚Äôs a great product but it would be better to have the one with a 16 gb RAM variant. There‚Äôs not a single retailer here selling it . So kindly make it available.
Business User,Received without charger and seal,I received the macbook air yesterday - but the power adapter is missing from the box. There was also no seal on the box
Arpan,It is a very nice machine,"I am basically use for coding and video editing.
This is very powerful machine. I am fully satisfied with this laptop."
