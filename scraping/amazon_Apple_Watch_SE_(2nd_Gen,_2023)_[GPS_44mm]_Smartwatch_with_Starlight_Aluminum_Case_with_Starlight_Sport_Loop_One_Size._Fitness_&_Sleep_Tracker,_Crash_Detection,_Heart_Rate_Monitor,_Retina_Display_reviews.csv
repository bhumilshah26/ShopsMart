Karthikeyan,Good and reliable watch.,Very good in terms of features and amazing quality. Reliable in terms of performance and battery capacity.
Vishvesh,The Perfect Budget Apple Watch,"This is the first time I am using an Apple Watch. After a lot of reviews and comparisons, I finally decided to go for the Apple Watch SE 2023 for:

1) The crisp AMOLED display (Always on Display not available) - If you guys need the AOD, please skip this watch.
2) Basic Features - As this is my first apple watch, I thought I need to get used to the UI and the gestures so I personally decided to go for the watch that has latest OS and processor with minimal and basic functions. (Blood Oxygen and ECG not available - if that is your priority, please skip this watch)
3) Smooth Watch OS - This is by far the best UI I have ever used in a smart watch. Everything looks good, works good and feels good.
4) Calling - The call quality in the watch is AMAZING! The user at the other end cannot tell the difference whether you're calling/communicating through your watch or through your phone.
5) Accuracy - I heard many reviewers saying that the apple watch is the measuring stick for all tracking (sleep, step, heart rate, etc) and it is indeed true. All the measurements are almost 95% accurate when compared to the high-end measuring devices.

Cons:
I have been using this watch for the past 2 months and never really found any noticeable cons. If found any, definitely I will update.

Overall it is an excellent product compared to other watches. Of course Samsung and Xiaomi offers better features such as AOD, Blood Oxygen Monitor, ECG, etc at a lesser price but still, considering the quality and user experience, definitely I would suggest this Apple Watch SE 2023.

I purchased this watch for 25k which is surprising as 44mm SE 2023 at that price range was confusing as 40mm was around 27-28k at that time. I did not see any notable offers but surprisingly, I got this for a low price tag which also makes me adore the purchase I made."

Rakesh Sharma,Buy watch 8 instead,"The prices for watch SE and Watch 8 are similar and you can get watch 8 till the stock lasts

So donâ€™t buy SE , instead buy watch 8"
