Jain,Worth the Price!,"A17 Pro chipset is definitely fast. Even with iOS 17.1.1 the phone heats up while using (surprisingly not much while charging through MagSafe Charger).
Fantastic camera setup, though a 5X zoom is missed. Speakers are loud and clear.
Battery life is good, charges fast on Apple 20W charger and the supplied braided TypeC to TypeC cable."
,Stunning,"10/10 for ux, screen size, copmatibility and arrived before estimated delivery date"
Akshiv kapil,Please get a protector for your camera as soon as possible,"Before using iPhone 15 pro, I used iPhone 12 Pro Max for almost 3 year, in that 3 year period, I accidentally dropped my phone dozens of time but nothing happened to the phone as it should be and as what all of us expect! But after using this new phone iPhone 15 pro for just 2 months, I accidentally dropped it from just waist height, that too on a plane surface, still it lead to break one of my camera glass !
So please don‚Äôt trust iPhone or all other YouTubers please do get a iPhone camera protector!"
,Goood,Love my phone
Amazon Customer,Worth an upgrade.,"Had upgraded from the Iphone 11 to 15 pro . Many changes and seamless experience but the only issue that exists is the heating issue . The phone heats up while charging , maybe its because of the fast charging but apart from that just browsing Instagram for a certain period heats up the phone. The phone is on the latest update but the issue for heating is yet to be resolved completely. Apart from that everything is flawless especially the camera. Its better if you upgrade from an old Iphone as the experience is flawless."
Revanth,My first iPhone,It‚Äôs been 4 days since I have picked it up and in love with it
Anirban Dey,Amazing product from Apple.,No heating issues till now. Smooth UI and camera setup amazed me.
,iPhone always best and IPhone 15 pro it‚Äôs too best,iPhone 15pro was extremely mind blowing superüòòüòò
Tilon,Best Phone at this price range (Pun intended),"I recently got into Apple system with a purchase of iPad Air 5. Looking at the my usage, iPad fit well with my overall system so I decided to switch to iPhone from OnePlus 7 after 4 years of usage.

I have to say that iPhone does have a premium feel to it, not only in appearance but in performance and UI too. Switching and transferring data and WhatsApp are fairly simple now with Move to IOS app. After setting up my phone in a day, it was ready for daily use without keeping my Android along as a secondary device.

Big worry before buying 15 pro was reported overheating issues but Apple has fixed that problem with iOS 17.0.3 and I haven‚Äôt encountered heating issues after initial setup process.

I will get straight to pros and cons below:

Pros:

1. ProMotion: You can feel 120hz vs 60hz right away.
2. Camera: Point and shoot without hassle. But one needs to check out few YouTube tutorials to understand Camera app settings thoroughly.
3. Customisation: Yes this sounds strange but Shortcuts app on iOS is so powerful. You can do many system level customisation with shortcuts and automation.
4. Battery life: With medium usage, I get through whole day. Stats for nerds: it averages above 4.2 min per 1% discharge and gives me 7+ hrs of estimated SOT. Estimated here because I don‚Äôt use full 0-100% charge and discharge cycles.
5. Performance and Security: No further description should be required.
6. 80% Charge limit: This setting helps when I keep my phone plugged in to car for CarPlay because it stops overcharging to 100%.
7. Weight: I haven‚Äôt myself experienced difference in in-hand feel of 15 Pro vs previous generation Pro models but my colleagues and friends who own Pro model of previous generations notice the difference in weight first hand.

Cons:

1. Apple keyboard takes some typing to get used to.
2. Notifications could be a mess if you like having notification from all apps enabled. I keep most of mine turned off so no biggie for me.
3. Simple tasks as custom ringtone, streaming music to car through Bluetooth needs work around or hacks you find on YouTube."
Sujoy Dasgupta,It could be better in battery and camera department,iPhones are becoming more competitive every year but this year a new iPhone Pro didn't last a day for me. 13 Pro and 14 Pro were better in battery department. I switched over to 15 Pro Max. Thanks to the less weight due to titanium body. This year Pro Max is the best choice or 15 Plus for budget.
I phone 15 pro natural titanium 256gb,Amazing,The phone was good but battery drains too fast .but as I listened 15 pro series having heating issues my device doesn't have.and not have any kind of bug
,You are getting what you see,"I had a iPhone 13 , and now switched to this, the main noticeable difference is the telephoto camera nothing much and the type c"
Adarsh Kunwar,Great with not so great battery,Battery doesn‚Äôt last long.
K,Bad battery life,"Battery life is not good. 14 pro and 14 plus has better battery life. Also, Heating issue is there which is irritating."
,"Ah, what to say even!!","Just got the hands on this new iP15Pro and well at the first glance it looks so classy but not as premium as old stainless steel models. Although bc of titanium body its now v light weight so kindda win win situation for me atleast. I have been using iP14PM from past 1 year now and had to say no significant difference i can notice in speed, camera and all. So final verdict If you are using old iP‚Äôs such as X,11,12 series then sure go ahead for iP15P/M but if you are using iP13,14 series then nahh dont upgrade not worth it at all. Also no heating issues I can feel in iP15Pro till now. Attached product image ;) Stay safe!!"
kriti,Fabulous is the word,"Sound quality , display, camera , video recording
, speed, response time‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ top notch.
Sound quality is supreme‚Ä¶ battery performance is good too‚Ä¶ getting 8-9 hrs screen time with normal usages. so happy with the purchase. Hitting issue is not there at all.
I suppose, Apple has fixed it with their new release. Whatever it is money you paid is worth every penny."
AVI deOry,Excellent Gadget,Bought it for my mum. Apple does not give any space to consumers to complain. She is happy with it and finds it of utmost use!

Waste of money."
Aniket Kakade,Perfect Pro,Heating issues is only rumours about this phone. I think after is update it is resolved
Devesh,Good,"Good product.
Thank you Amazon for your service and delivering genuine product."
,Not accepting return and replacement,"They are not accepting return or replacement, although its clearly mentioned 7 days replacement policy. They are saying you need to visit brand store. Why do I visit brand store if its eligible for replacement. Don't buy this. There are lots of heating issues.

I am going to make a consumer complaint against it.

1. Camera quality is much better in iphone 11
2. Not satified with build quality
3. Heating issues are there, even after upgrading to latest software"

Amazon Customer,Product damaged. Worst. Item defective.,Item was delivered with damage. Item not working as well. Very Worst experience. No proper channel to contact for assistance.

Amit V.,Smooth Best Performance,1St Review for 15 Pro üòçüòçüòç Go for Natural titanium‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ but s23 have best display then 15 pro‚Ä¶.
Harsh Viper,Good phone but not worth buying,"Performance is best in class, design same as boring old design, cost hight, overall not worth buying with same experience as 15 and 14 no change better to go with 13. Even just 15 has better value for money ratio than 15 pro. 13 is value for money if u have money then go for 15. 15 pro is waste of money"
B. Vennela,Thanks for Amazon üòç,"Good product

,Stunner,"I‚Äôm already in apple ecosystem.

I‚Äôd an iPhone 14 which I brought in may.

Since I was already on a trip in Thailand, brought this for 98k there.

The mere feeling of holding the fastest phone on the planet with the first 3nm chip which can even play PC/PS5 level games is too Damn awesome!"
Sid,"Great as always, but not worth the price tag",Bought a 15 Pro from Dubai for 90k and it‚Äôs great iPhone for that price. But it‚Äôs extremely overpriced in India. There‚Äôs no way this iPhone is worth 1.3L. Avoid buying it in India or go for a 13-14 (both are great)
aditya,Honest review,This is a very good product. Infact the medical procedures I had go through is pain full. I never in my life thought to sell my kidney. Hope hospitals get sufficient organs for transplantations by the customers of apple. Once again I value the black screen after going blind (No pun intended).

,Beast phone ü§≥,"The iPhone 15 Pro Max is a true testament to Apple's commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology and design. As the latest addition to the iPhone lineup, this flagship device showcases a myriad of improvements that redefine the smartphone experience."
SHAJJO SHAHJAHAN,Almost the perfect iphone,"Let's get something out of the way first , the phone does not heat that much even when playing games.It warms up if you play games for longer period of time.

Let's get into pro's

1 - Screen for the pro model is 120hz and you can clearly see the difference between pro and normal iphone 15 . You will just love the screen
2- Camera set up is just brilliant , pictures comes up crisp and clear with 48mp camera.With 3 camera set up in pro models this just takes the cake. Low light photos are decent too
3-Type c charging is a big plus , now i can charge it with any charger if needed . Try buying a a fast charger which will do the trick
4- Dynamic island is very useful and i love it , used it for uber and it came out aces.

cons

1- It warms up not heated when playing games for longer hours
2- Price point is a tough for this , if you can get some credit cards offers then great"
Anubhab,No charger,Apple I phone cost more then 1 lakh but without charger ‚Ä¶..what is this????? Rs2000 mobile also giving charger and headphones etc
Mani,Worth the hype,"I have been using this phone for more than 2 months now..no issue at all. Classy look, stands out.
Loved it."
MJ,Heating issues even with original apple charger,"Camera is better, suggest not to use other charger adapter. Always use apple charger cable rather using other type C cable."
Anuruddha Paul,A Glimpse into the Future.,"The iPhone 15 Pro is a technological marvel, pushing the boundaries of what a smartphone can do. Its impressive A15X chip delivers unparalleled performance, making multitasking a breeze. The camera system, with enhanced low-light capabilities, captures stunning photos and videos. The stunning ProMotion display with a 120Hz refresh rate offers a silky-smooth visual experience. The only downside is its hefty price tag, but for those seeking the pinnacle of smartphone innovation, the iPhone 15 Pro doesn't disappoint. It's a glimpse into the future of mobile technology."
Sachin Jain,Nice phone,"Writing this review for iPhone 15 pro 256 GB after one month usage. It's a nice phone with buttery smooth performance and brilliant camera setup. Battery also lasts for a whole day. Initially the phone had heating issue but after a few days (when OS and updates got settled) the issue was resolved automatically.
Overall a nice phone."
,The Beast of all Phones,"This is the best iPhone launched by apple. The titanium feels really good and super classy! The gaming experience is top notch, its a console in a phone! None can beat that. A17 pro chip speaks of itself! super pro. I didn‚Äôt experience any heating issues, great battery experience, even though i didn‚Äôt get it from amazon due to product constraints, was able to get from the apple store itself on launch day.
Go for it! Worth it. I bought the blue titanium and its really nice!"

Very smooth compared to poco f1 camara also good,Most Worst Phone By Apple(I Phone15)series,"I have iPhone 14 & 14ProMax
I bought Iphone15 Pro at the time of Launching of 15 but should say 14 Series is not only the best but the showstoppers for today's generation.
Don't Buy iPhone 15 it's very pathetic and don't works properly in the sense of Camera in working performance.
Don't waste your Hard earned money...."
Aryan Bidkar,High price,Very high price.. no need to spend this much high hard earned money to just a mobile phone. You can build an awesome pc with this money...
