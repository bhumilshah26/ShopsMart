In summary, getting the iPhone 13 during the Great Indian Festival was an absolute steal. From the incredible screen to the reliable battery life and stunning camera, it's exceeded my expectations. If you're on the fence, take the plunge ‚Äì you won't be disappointed."
ApTreX,Truly worth the money spent! Even if you go broke!,"My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.
I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!
I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.

iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can‚Äôt believe what I‚Äôm seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.

I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn‚Äôt disappointing.

Display quality is truly flagship level and I‚Äôm quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.
I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don‚Äôt think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.

You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.

Speakers are Great.

Battery life is better than my previous devices,
iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.
NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.

For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.

But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.
Truly worth it."

Faiyaz,Review after 1 month of use,"I would say I made a great desicion to switch from Android to Apple Iphone. Though the Iphone 13 released few years back but still today it can be the best choice for those who are planning to go fo Iphone.

It gives you the smooth experience without any lags and top notch performance. Talking about the camera I would say its just perfect and there are many hidden features are there to explore.

battery backup is also amazing, no heating issue battery may drop quick but not like other android phones if you run heavy games like BGMI.

Just go for it."
,Very good for the price it‚Äôs being offered for right now,"Love it! The camera quality stands out for me it‚Äôs too good, the screen is vibrant and I get one day battery backup upon minimal use. iPhone definitely has a clean and sophisticated user experience (except the notification tabs)."
Rishikumar Thakur,Using after 3 months honest review,"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-
1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User
2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.
3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.
4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.
5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.
6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.
7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.
8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.
9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.

These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things."
Deon v,Loving it!!,"Bought the iPhone 13 from Amazon and it's everything I expected and more. Sleek design, powerful performance, excellent camera, and seamless integration with other Apple devices. Fully satisfied and highly recommend it."

TANI PARTNER,iPhone 13 (BLUE),"iPhone 13 is like wow , I have updated from my iPhone SE 2020 to 13 and then I‚Äôm feeling like wonderful.the phone camera is 4.5 out of 5 .
Multitasking is very easy and thanks to Amazon for secure packaging."
T.J.RAAHUL,Wholesome bundle of worthiness - iPhone 13,"Best of all the iPhones. If anyone wants to update from previous generation iPhones then they can easily upgrade because this is easily one of the best model one could ask for. All features in this successor models is available in 13 itself, except few camera upgrade, GPU upgrade and little bit battery upgrade. Considering all the above points, 13 is one of the best and affordable model one could easily ask for"

Nagendra Singh Madnawat,Review after 1 week of usage,"Got it for 65K on Amazon prime day. So as a lifelong android user I have switched to IOS. So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:
Product red 128GB
Pros:
1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)
2) Built quality excellent
3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.
4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.
5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.
6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.
7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thump

Cons:
1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.
2) File management system sucks, android is much better.
3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.
4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.
5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.
6) No USB C
7) Siri is dumb AF
8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.
9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.
10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.
11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16

Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.

Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.

Hope this helps in making your decision easier.

Update after 2 weeks of usage:

All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.
1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.
2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone."
debarghyo chaudhuri,Awesome,.
Akshay Mokashi,An all-rounder,"This phone won‚Äôt disappoint you in any aspect,whether it‚Äôs the battery life,performance or the cameras but what you might miss is a 120hz screen or perhaps a telephoto lens but if those things do not concern you then there‚Äôs actually no reason for you to not buy this, it‚Äôs the best phone if you can get it for under 50k,period."
,Amazon helped me again,"I was dying to buy this at an affordable rate and amazon made it happen, the packaging was nice and the product is in amazing condition"
vijay nayak,üòäüòä,Good üëç
Nick,Best deal even in 2024,Great camera and good perfomance. Only issue is glare in night time videos due to light sources.Battery life is also good
Basit Jinabade,As Expected,Apple is the leader in smartphone
kumar raja,Crazy beast,"In love with the product ,
Red Colour is just amazing .
Got this for less price in great Amazon festival .
Value for money , enjoying luxury & apple legacy ."
Ananth Machiraju,The iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones...!,"We're pretty confident when we say that the iPhone 13 is the best iPhone for most people. It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.

Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.

The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.

The overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene, I could make out individual hairs on Neo‚Äôs beard as he stared up into the sun.

DISPLAY
1. Smaller notch makes the display a bit more immersive
2. Slightly different button placement
3. Pink and blue are standout colors
4. New Green color launched March 2022

CAMERA
1. Bright and colorful images beat Samsung
2. Ultra-wide camera delivers more scenes and improved Night mode
3. Photographic styles give you creative control

VIDEO
1. Cinematic mode automatically changes focus on subjects while adding bokeh
2. Superior Dolby Vision HDR video quality

PERFORMANCE and A15 Bionic
1.A15 Bionic is the fastest chip once again
2. Machine learning performance notably better

BATTERY LIFE
1.10 hours and 33 minutes of battery life, which is 2 hours better than the iPhone 12

Software
1.SharePlay lets you watch videos and listen to music with friends
2. Focus cuts down on distractions

VERDICT :
The iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12‚Äôs endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.

I don‚Äôt think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionic‚Äôs muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks.

I‚Äôm also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on par with Android flagships. I‚Äôd like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around ‚Äî be it via USB-C or MagSafe ‚Äî as well as a 120Hz display.

The bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do."
,Massive oneüåü,Its been more than 3 months since i purchased this during great Indian festival season in oct... quality is impressive... packaging is impressive but only one thing that i give it 4stars that amazon didn't provide open box delivery for this order....ü´• otherwise no issues...
Sarvesh,Love this phone,"Costly but worth it camera is awesome but i think battery should last little longer perfect fits in hand
Display quality is not as price but superb but blacks are good"
akash k.,Find the appreciation,"I just love this model! Yes please would argue that it‚Äôs an old model but hear me out. The battery backup is substantially better than 14/15. The camera quality stands at power, the charging even tho not C type charges pretty quickly, the base and the speakers it‚Äôs pretty good. And even though the refresh rate is not that great, but it‚Äôs the exact same in 14/15.
Not just that but there have been certain major issues with both those models that have put them on a really low selling models for Apple."
Aditi Mukherjee,Smooth as butter,This is very much first time I am using an Iphone and my experience is very good until now. UI is very seamless and lag free but yes sometimes i noticed app crashing or getting refresh in background. Camera quality is superb especially for videography. Night photos are ok but can still see grains while taking photo in low light situation.
KARAN UDAY NAGVEKAR,Iphone,The iPhone 13 is superb
Madhupriya,Always wanted to buy an Iphone!,"Reviewing after 4 months of usage. Like everyone else I always wanted to buy an Iphone. Tbh, camera is the best about it. I still use an Android for daily use and I don't think Iphone interface is user friendly for a long term Android user. But yes, Iphone is really awesome for the camera!"
