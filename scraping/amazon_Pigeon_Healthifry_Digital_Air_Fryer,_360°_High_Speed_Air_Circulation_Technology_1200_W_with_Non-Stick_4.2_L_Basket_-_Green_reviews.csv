Amazon Customer,Good value proposition and very good product,Want quick frying and less oil consumption electronic appliance .....I am happy
JIBIN,A good fryer at affordable rate,"The product looks almost exactly like in the image, in short, its good looking. The buttons or switches on the top are touch type and response after 6 months is that it is still responsive. Not to forget, that the first piece i got stopped working in 2 days. But just follow the customer care guidelines, and they got me replaced the defected ine with a new one in just a couple of days. I think, this is an optimal size for a family of 3-5 members though u might need 2-3 batches depending upon the dish u r preparing. Pakodas are tastier when fried in oil, but since its a healthier and economical option, u may compromise a bit on the same taste and texture. French frys, fish fry, chicken tandoori, chicken tikka tastes really good in it. The average time to cook chicken would be around 25-40 minutes. U can also use it to boil water, heat food/ snack, bake cookies."
P.Singh,Awesome product,Ur service is excellent
Lalitha,Who want to save time for deep fry and non veg food cooking,"This air fryer 8 months ago I thought this is the right time to post a review I think I got enough time to review its pros and cons.
Pros:
1)look of the air fryer is very royal
2)as a working women I can cook recipes very quick and it's saving lot of time instead of standing long time in front of stove.
3)less usage of oil it's very good feature I like most
4)as a chicken and fish lover I cook most of different non veg items with very less amount of time
Cons:
1)The fry tray provided is very delicate and fry items are stick to tray every time
2)nonstick coating is removing very fast if wash the tray.
Over all happy with product and if they provide extra tray it's worth for money and time"
,Good but not great,"The air frier is good. It's okay for everyday use but it's not anything great. Plus the built quality feels kind of cheap, so 3 stars"
Amazon Customer,Very good performance but low built quality of bottom plate,"The sir fryer performance and quality is very good in terms of cooking but when it comes to quality of bottom plate the teflon coating comes out in matter of 5 to 6 uses when we fried fish on it the teflon coating sticks to fish skin and comes off very frequently, in all other cases the product is extraordinary"
yogesh,Good product if not purchase oven.,Very good product. This is replacement of oven.
Amazon Customer,Amazing product value for money,I was in a two mind before ordering it but proceeded with ordering it and i must say it is worth it. I got some issue with my product as it shows E1 after 2 min of frying then i raised an issue and got call from service centre and told us to bring air fryer to service centre it is the only issue tha t i have to take it to service centre by myself. They got it repaired and next day i brought it home and its working fine now.

Wagh Amol,Not that good,"I bought this product on 18/08/2023, but it was not switching on, so I replaced the item with new one, which worked for around 3-4 month and then it got failed to start up. It is not getting switch on now, completely dead. If it is working it is a good product but its your fate, if this is working.
Be careful while buying this product. The contact number provided on the website for Warranty support is continuously switched off. Amazon is also helpless for the after sales support.
I have sent an email for the support and waiting for their reply now. After a week as well I didn't get the reply from them"
Nitin Gupta,Not a worthy investment,"I tried many things on this air fryer in 3 months of its purchase and let me tell you results
Cup cake:unbaked from within
Aloo tikki:unbaked from within
Pizza:burnt from top
French fries:toomuch chewy
Grill paneer and grill pineapple:wet marination from bottom despite cooking for 20 mins
Aloo besan pakoda:uncooked from bottom
Samosa: too crispy
Kurkuri bhindi:very crisp,few got burnt
I just couldn't figure who was at fault,the airfryer or my cooking method...

I didn't like the product much but i do use it occasionally for making samosas and pakodas as I have spent money on this...i just make sure to flip theses foods upside down after half cooking is done..
The air fryer is like an OTG with heating from top...so it grills solid food from top...but don't expect much from this product...I would personally not recommend it to others...

Edit: after 5months of use

It's good for dry roast of papads, dry fruits and masalas...mycup cake turned out slightly more dry with harder outer layer when compared to that of OTG... it is very difficult to puff puris in it.."

Chandrakumar P.,For healthy cooking,Best products as such a price the food tastes so good and is healthy with less oil useage. Does not use much space it is compact and looks classy
Niriksha shetty,Defective item received. Display doesn't work.,"I just received this item and the power doesn't come up. I have tried in 3 different plug points. However, the power doesn't turn on and the display just doesn't come up. Spoke to an agent from Amazon. They have offered a replacement. However, needed the item urgently as it's a gift. Now, after a little push here and there, the display has finally come up. Seems to be working now. Haven't cooked anything. Hope it does work. I would suggest that Amazon test their products properly before sending out to customers."
Sowmya,Nice product,"I have bought this product, which is convenient and best . Best to buy and we can make more recipes."
Sumita Das,Teflon came off within 1 week of usage,"Has been using it to fry nuggets and fries, your usual evening snacks, but I noticed the teflon covering coming off in a great many places causing the food to stick to the plate. Also, another of my relatives bought the same exact model , the fan stopped working after a while. Service centers are scanty in these areas, so had to return the product. I'd say the product itself is pretty good in this price range, does the work it's supposed to do but there are some problems that one might need to be aware of."
,Good airfryer,"Reviewing after using it for 3 months. Best airfryer in 3 k range. You can make potato wedges,fries,fish fry,pakoras etc with very less oil that's amazing. Opt it for Healthy way of cooking food"

Dhanesh,The customer service of pigeon is the worst,"The tray and the mesh rusted out completely after using for less than 2 months. Tried calling contact service and they picked up call but now they are not picking up call even after 6 months.

Contacted Amazon and they gave me a wrong pigeon contact info. Amazon has not been useful at all with the warrenty either."
