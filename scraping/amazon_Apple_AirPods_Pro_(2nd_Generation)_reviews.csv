Naidu,Unmatched Audio Excellence: Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen),"I recently upgraded to the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation), and I am beyond thrilled with the exceptional experience they deliver. These earbuds have not only met but exceeded my expectations in every aspect.

Audio Quality:
The audio quality is nothing short of spectacular. The dynamic range, clarity, and immersive soundstage elevate my music, podcasts, and calls to a whole new level. The active noise cancellation is a game-changer, effortlessly blocking out external noise and immersing me in the audio experience.

Comfort and Fit:
The design of the AirPods Pro is a testament to Apple's commitment to user comfort. The in-ear design with customizable silicone tips ensures a snug and secure fit, making them perfect for extended use. Whether I'm working out, commuting, or simply relaxing, they stay in place without causing any discomfort.

Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:
The active noise cancellation is incredibly effective, creating a serene listening environment even in bustling surroundings. On the flip side, the Transparency Mode is a genius addition, allowing me to stay aware of my surroundings without removing the earbuds. It's like having control over my auditory environment.

Build Quality and Design:
As expected from Apple, the build quality is impeccable. The sleek and compact charging case is not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical for on-the-go use. The touch controls on the earbuds are responsive and intuitive, adding to the overall user-friendly design.

Battery Life:
The battery life is impressive. With the case providing multiple charges, I rarely find myself needing to plug them in. The quick charge feature is a lifesaver, giving me hours of use with just a short charge.

Integration with Apple Ecosystem:
The seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem is a standout feature. From automatic device pairing to Siri integration, the AirPods Pro seamlessly integrate with my iPhone, iPad, and Mac, enhancing the overall user experience.

In conclusion, the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) are a masterpiece of audio technology. They combine unparalleled sound quality, comfort, and advanced features in a sleek and sophisticated package. While they may be an investment, the enhanced listening experience and convenience make them worth every penny. I wholeheartedly recommend the AirPods Pro to anyone in search of the ultimate wireless earbud experience."
kunal wadhwa,Received a genuine Apple product!,"Finally got my hands on the Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) and I'm happy that the product is 100% genuine. The sound quality and immersive audio experience have truly impressed me. The Noise Cancellation feature surpasses any other competitor in the market (obviously), and it stays snugly in my ear even during intense workouts at the gym.

All in all, I'm quite satisfied with the product (so far). The only minor drawback I'd say is that the audio bass could be a bit stronger. Still, the audio quality, the features, the battery life, and the overall fit make it a perfect travel companion."
vivek tiwari,AirPods Pro 2nd gen,"Overall good product and amazing sound quality.
ANC works very well and transparency mode is also great. All the features justify the price."
,10/10 if you have Apple Ecosystem,"Highly recommended for ecosystem. Seamless connection with iPhone and MacBook. Honestly subpar sound quality if compared with Sony wf xm4 and 5. But surprisingly when in spatial mode, we can see significant improvement in sound staging and quality. Can be placed on the same page as xm4,5 when spatial audio is on. Battery backup could have been better. Overall satisfied."
Sai,Great product,"We have found it great in build quality,
The sound is super amazing, you just need to hear the sound from it, thankyou so much for providing genuine quality airpods."
Gaurav sharma,An Immersive Audio Experience,"As an avid music lover and tech enthusiast, I recently had the opportunity to test the AirPods Pro, and I must say, they exceeded my expectations in every way possible. Apple's flagship wireless earbuds have truly set a new standard for premium audio and convenience.

Design and Comfort:
The first thing that caught my attention was the sleek and compact design of the AirPods Pro. The in-ear form factor with customizable silicone tips ensures a secure and comfortable fit, making them ideal for long listening sessions without causing discomfort. Additionally, the Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) feature effectively blocks out external noises, allowing me to immerse myself in the music.

Audio Quality:
When it comes to audio quality, the AirPods Pro truly shine. The sound is incredibly crisp, with well-balanced mids, clear highs, and punchy bass. Whether I'm listening to classical symphonies or grooving to the latest hip-hop tracks, the AirPods Pro deliver an impressive audio experience that remains unparalleled in the true wireless earbud market.

Transparency Mode:
One standout feature that impressed me was the Transparency Mode. With a simple press, I could instantly switch from ANC to Transparency Mode, which allowed me to stay aware of my surroundings without removing the earbuds. This feature came in handy during outdoor activities, ensuring my safety while still enjoying my music.

Noise-Canceling:
The AirPods Pro's Active Noise Cancellation is hands down one of the best I've experienced. It effectively eliminates background noise, making them perfect for busy commutes or when I need to focus in a noisy environment. It significantly enhances the overall listening experience, helping me get lost in my favorite tunes without distractions.

Battery Life and Wireless Charging:
While the battery life of the AirPods Pro is not exceptionally long, it is adequate for most daily use. With ANC enabled, I consistently got around 4.5 to 5 hours of continuous playback, which is quite impressive considering the active noise-canceling feature. The wireless charging case is also a convenient addition, providing multiple charges on the go without the hassle of cables.

Connectivity and Controls:
Pairing the AirPods Pro with my Apple devices was seamless and hassle-free. Once paired, they automatically connect to the device whenever I open the case. The touch controls on the earbuds are responsive and intuitive, allowing me to control music playback, answer calls, and access Siri effortlessly.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the AirPods Pro is a top-of-the-line true wireless earbud offering from Apple that delivers outstanding audio quality, comfort, and cutting-edge features. From the moment I put them on, I was blown away by the immersive audio experience and the convenience they provided. If you are looking for the best wireless earbuds on the market, the AirPods Pro should undoubtedly be at the top of your list."
Sadashiv B Malannavar,Is it worth it?,"Okay! So,i paid for this product is 23500 which is a hefty amount for me! But the features it unlocks, the experience is so different, i think each of you should have it once in a life! Like, the noice cancellation is 5/5, connectivity 5/5 ,transparency 4/5 and the most important sound quality- i consider the bass is a little bit lower but and this but is huge because when you listen the music in high res audio my god that is so amazing! If you have money and an iphone again i will repeat an iphone then purchase it immediately but if you dont have an iphone then don’t consider it once instead purchase sony xm400 or whatever they are.
Ab mai chala soone byeeee"
ARIHANT JAIN,Won’t regret this purchase,"Apple does what it promises. I really needed some good earphones for calling. I was not expecting the bundle of features it came with and quality would be so good and useful. No one can beat the noise cancellation feature. Spatial audio is also very nice. Mic quality is awesome. I tested calling while on the bike, running, at gym and bar where there was lot of disturbance but these earphones took care of everything. Please check your product carefully. For me, it was not properly sealed. I hope there won’t be any issue with these pair."
Gaurav Saini,Really awesome.,Quality was good.. I like it very much
,Best in class as always Apple claim,As always no doubt about Apple products. Noise cancellation is up to the mark. The only drawback is battery backup as compared to other competitors.
Placeholder,Better and Original,"I would recommend buying this over the cheap copies, got the original stuff, works as expected. Buy only if necessary and many more other products are available but it’s quality is way better than Bose, H&K, Beats, etc. I have used them all so I know it."
Kartikay,Warranty,"Everything was good. The product is original the quality is good. But the warranty is not for 1 year. Amazon and the seller has mentioned it is for 1 year. But the product i have received today on 18th January,2024 is only covered till October 2024. I have received a 3 year old device. I am not sure what can be done next"
Vivekk,Best product,"Though higher price in market compared to other competitors product, it’s worth it.
My previous cheaper products stayed alive only for year or so. It was bit of hectic to spend 2k to 3k every year.
Apple has given the best alternative. One time purchase, but it’s the best. It’s already a year, it looks very new."
Karthik,"Great earphones, definitely not value for money like every other apple product","If you are considering buying it get it wrapped or apply any laminate as it get scratched very easily mine already had minor scratches, even with scratches it’s worse, so don’t do that mistake"
,ANC Like no other,No words to express Apple Airpods. Simply breathtaking ANC. You get what you pay for. No exceptions.
Hardik Dalia,Best in class,"Balanced sound, comfortable fit and U1 chips in left/right earbuds plus case which makes it unique"
Mrinal Pradhan,Expensive but best,I have no word for this amazing product ☺️
Piyush kumar,This is not the one with the USB C port for charging and has the older lightning port.,"When I came across this steal deal on amazon, I thought it was a great deal. However, everything comes with a catch, the AirPods were the older version with the lightning port and not a USB C port. I felt cheated but decided to keep the AirPods as I was travelling and the return would have been problematic."
,Quality is nice,Everything works so nice ANC is mind blowing and transparency mode is works nice really worth is product.
Anuj Srivastava,Best,Best
NAAZ PARVEEN,Best,Best
shivanka,Great Product,"Airpods is excellent. With fantastic noise cancellation and spatial feature. But i do face fitment issues with the buds, it pops right out of my ear and i had to buy a rubber string to keep it from falling. Otherwise, a good buy"
Ansh,It’s original. It’s resounding. It’s magnanimous. It’s EXPENSIVE! 😅,People who say it’s not much different from AirPods Pro 1 are the same ones who say FIAT is as good as Merc. Yes you’ve it all in the first one but the a smal step is a giant leap and it’s for you to try and no words can put across the difference in a more subtle way than actually trying it. Some things are worth experiencing to know the difference
Anku,Product is good,Sound & feature are good
Lalla Shenoy,Nice packaging,"I’ve always wanted to buy apple airpods gen 2pro
And i got amazing deal in amazon
Originally this airpods price is around ₹26,999
But i got this in only 18,999
And i think thats a good offer I’ve gotten!
Thanks🙂"
Arjun,Avoid! If looking for a USB C port,"This one comes with a lightening port, while on the Apple website it comes with a USB C charging port. Hence, it is cheaper on Amazon as it is outdated."
Suraj P.,Good integration to ios,"Impressed with integration with the iPhone, reading out messaged and etc.. The sound quality is good but anc noise cancellation is OKAY. My previous Jabra was better"
,THIS IS NOT TYPE C,"Don’t get confused thinking this is 2nd gen AirPods pro with type C connectivity. This is lightning cable connectivity and hence the price. Apart from that the product is great. Adaptive transparency, conversation awareness is a game changer on a daily basis.

They could have worked on the dust proof side of things better. You could easily find dust after cleaning the case regularly."
Alex Joseph,Good,Good
Roshan,Good EarPod,"All good about this AirPod , but price is a bit high ."
Jabberwocky,Genuine Product!,"With the SBI Card discount, this was almost ₹7000 cheaper than at Maple. After losing 1 AirPod piece, I bought this with a lot of trepidation because it looked too good to be true. But to my relief, it’s a genuine generation 2 recognised by my iPhone with warranty confirmation and of course everything works perfectly! It’s an AirPod!!"
Nishant Beriwal,Simply Best,"A week’s battery back up basis an hour plus usage daily.
Ultimate sound quality, bass is good and noise cancellation is superb.
Pairs with two iPhones at the same time. Fits in ear perfectly.
Seamless experience"
Rohan Pradhan,Way too overpriced,"The ANC is amazing and features integrated with iOS are nice. The sound is mediocre at best. No way these earphones should cost more than 5k. Buy it if you need good ANC, if you want good sound, look for something else."
,Apple product,If you have apple devices need to have an earbud just go for it.
Tanmoy k.,Received Genuine and Awesome product,"Its been 20 days i am using Apple AirPods pro2 really enjoying this product, seamlessly compatible with Phone and Computer, using it for Music / Office Teams /Zoom calls and working fine.
I also checked the authenticity of product in Apple care and found it genuine.
Thanks Amazon for keeping up the trust with great 29% discount."
Prathap,Thik h,But noise cancellation not good
pukhraj,Amazing,After seeing so many negative reviews on Google about this seller i was bit confused but getting them on cheap price i took the risk today i got my original airpods pro 2 generation with warranty n everything they send me in shoe box first impression was like i m ded now 😂😂 but then I opened it got the airpods inside the shoe box 📦 second generation pro airpods are much much better than first one definitely recommend go get them 😍
Safir hussain,ok but not great,features are good but when i received it some features was not working then i had to visit the service centre than dont know what they did and it was working but now facing one more problem that is its alarming automatic any time while it is not in use even.
,Apple AirPods Pro 2 (Lightning Connector),The AirPods is superb. I brought it during the Amazon Great Indian Festival event and trust me the product is top-notch. If you are looking to buy an Apple AirPods then absolutely go for it. The product is 100% original and genuine. It comes with a 1 year warranty. Great product. Superb.
