Santo,Awesome masterpiece by Apple!,"Thank you Amazon for quick delivery. I was looking initially in Aptronix stores for Indigo Alpine loop Ultra2 model but couldn‚Äôt find it anywhere near. I booked in Amazon and I got it within a day. It‚Äôs original and I am happily satisfied with the packaging.
Coming to watch , I come from watch7 series and I noticed huge improvement in battery life though screen size looks almost same as mine was 45mm previously. The watch is little pricey as we will get iPhone 15 with that price but if you are willing to keep it for next 5 years it‚Äôs really worth every penny. Look and touch wise is excellent as it comes with titanium metal and sapphire display. I have buyed spigen armor case because I didn‚Äôt took apple care and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs needed because the watch itself is armor heavy protective and it can take heavy beating and wear regularly. I highly recommend Amazon services and ultra2 if you are willing to spend money and need best smart watch."

,AFTER A WEEK.,"I went swimming with my series 6 and it stopped working. I have given it for repair. I was considering the stainless steel variant but was driven to the ultra 2 by its looks, features and the promised battery life with higher brightness on the watch. Also I allowed myself to buy it because I thought I would use it for at least 3 years. An Apple watch is not something you change every two years to be fair as the advancements are very minimal and hardly noticeable. So in the following points, I would like to discuss the various aspects of this watch. I will talk without any reservation and you must understand I come from a place of a new ultra watch user..

1. Display - It is not nearly as bright as they say, in fact it is barely cosy. The difference I get it is because of screen display technology and sharpness. But please dont be fooled. I have not once said to myself this is brighter or remarkably better than my 40mm series 6 was. So don't go crazy expecting a lot. You will be disappointed.

2. Battery - This is scarily good. With my series 6 a 100% charge with a 40-50 minute exercise day would probably be at 30% by evening. In this case the watch (maybe cause it's new) is barely at 65% at the end of the day and you can easily use this for 2 days straight. Please note all apple products have good battery life in the beginning and mostly maintain the same so I will update my review in 3 months and so on.

3. Overall Functionality - Aside from the bigger screen and the shortcut button, there is literally nothing about the Apple Watch ultra that is truly physically remarkable. No real value addition except the big heft of it and that super truck looking thing. Please dont buy it thinking you will get a lot of bang for your buck utility wise. Most of you will be happy with an Apple Watch 8, or even a SE variant. This is a sad but true point I wanted to write for those looking to spend 90k on this thing.

4. Call Quality - Marginally better when talking but have not used enough for formative opinion. When I say call quality I speak of the speaker phone talk-experience.

5. Heft - Though I have biceps and a good physique for an almost 40 year old guy, I have tiny or medium sized wrists. The watch still manages to look good. This is a major plus point as I was thinking it will look funny as I went from a 40mm to a 49mm.

6. The strap sucks. It will look bad in max 1-2 months and I am not even a dirty person.

7. FULL TIME ON SCREEN DISPLAY - this works when it wants to and is a poor thing.

The setting up of the device took one hour as I had to call Airtel and ask them to disconnect old watch.
I am still going to get my series 6 repaired for 15k and then update you guys soon..

including 1-2 photos.

Overall - 3 stars nothing more. Of course the rating is likely to go up."

,"If you have much money , please give something of it to the poor people.","Price is ecessive.
Not value for money.Low battery life. However it may be over priced itdoes not give proper accuracy."
