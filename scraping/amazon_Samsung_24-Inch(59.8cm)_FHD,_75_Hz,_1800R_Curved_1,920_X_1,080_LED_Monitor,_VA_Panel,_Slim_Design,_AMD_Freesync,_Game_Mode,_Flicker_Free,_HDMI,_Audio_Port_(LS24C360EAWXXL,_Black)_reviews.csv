komalsutar,Product is really good,"I gifted this whole set to my husband on valentine's day to make his trading career path and his hardwork little smooth and easier.‚ù§Ô∏èüíñ

Thanks Samsung for this valuable affordable and lovable product..All the reviews for this product are so useful and that's why I buy this screen and that chair aswell.. it cost me 14 k for Both. And my husband loved it üíû"
,Affordable Immersion: Great Monitor for Non-Gamers,"This monitor, while not ideal for gaming, pleasantly surprised me considering its price. The picture quality is excellent, with vibrant colors and sharp details. However, it's not designed for gaming enthusiasts. What sets this monitor apart is the curved screen, which creates an immersive experience for watching movies and series. If you're not a hardcore gamer and want an affordable monitor for everyday tasks and media consumption, this one is worth considering."
Madhav,Samsung is always know for reliable and good quality.,"Hi,
Very good and reliable series of monitors from Samsung brand. Do not think twice just get it."
Kirk Packaging Solutions Pvt. Ltd.,Good product,"I brought it for 10k, but price dropped during festivals, its a good product"
Placeholder,Great Display with crisp and accurate colours!,"Needed a replacement for my 18.5inch Dell HD monitor. I'd decided to go for a fullHD monitor, and being the owner of a 40inch fullHD Samsung TV, it made sense to go for the same brand. Having used it for about a month now, I'd say I'm pretty satisfied. Moving from a HD to a fullHD panel naturally raises the graphics to the next level, but said, this is one of the better panels in the market under 15K. The colours are vivid and the colour gamut is impressive. The blacks are especially good compared to my previous monitor.

Note though that these work on the ordinary visual settings with Samsung's picture enhancement turned on. There are two modes but I didn't really find much difference between the two. If you're using Eye Saver Mode though, the visuals do get somewhat washed out. The blacks start appearing as greys and there is some noise in vivid scenes. However, if you're (like me) inclined towards warm white settings, these are tolerable. If you're watching a movie with your girlfriend and she wants truer visuals, you can always return to the original settings.

This brings me to the ""joystick"" at the back of the display. It is essentially a omnidirectional button that can be tilted in different directions to change settings. Operating such a button without seeing it (unless you're moving back and forth between the front and rear of the monitor or doing the ostrich over it) seemed tricky at best. But once you figure out the directions, it's actually better than there being a ton of buttons. It keeps the front clean and allows quick change of settings when the need arrives. It'd have been better if they'd placed the button at the bottom of the panel rather than someway up, but it is still tolerable.

A note on the curvature - it doesn't really affect you much, either positively or negatively. Most of your focus would be on the center of the screen (at least if you're gaming) and the peripheral parts don't really figure that much. I was quite hyped about owning a curved monitor, but in hindsight, it isn't something I'd mark as the USP.

Lastly, the device comes with a 3.5mm jack, a HDMI port and a VGA port. Tried all three, and they work fine. There is a VGA cable bundled with the monitor but you'd have to arrange your own HDMI cable if you want to go digital. The power connector, sadly, is similar to those used on laptops instead of being the standard plug used by PSUs and other computer peripherals. So if you plan to recycle your old monitor's power cable, chances are you won't be able to.

So am I satisfied ? Despite the curvature not being the most impressive thing, the monitor has plenty to offer to both the movie lover and the gamer. Colours are beautiful and crisp, blacks are accurate and while I haven't tried out the extremes, viewing angles seem decent. With what limited knoweldge I have of the monitor market, I can happily reccomend this Samsung beauty to anyone with a budget below 15K."
Ari,Awesome but not very suited for 1080p,The picture quality is good. The monitor will perfectly display 4k or 1920p graphics but seems quite pixelated with 1080p graphics.
,Should you get it?,"This monitor isn't really for everyone. It's a good monitor, I really liked some aspects of it, but the cons of this monitor overwhelm the pros of the monitor, not by much though. If you can live through the cons, this monitor just might be for you. Gonna start with the cons:
1. Backlight Bleeding - If you don't know what this means, the LCD(liquid crystal display), the screen, is Backlit by CCFL/LED's, the LCD blocks out the backlight that is not needed when displaying a particular image. When this light is not 100% blocked, allowing excess light to ""bleed"" around the edges of the LCD panel.
This issue makes the background light up at some spots at the edges on a dark/black background. This is really annoying. It did bother me. This type of issue happens when the monitors are not 'factory calibrated'.
2. Viewing Angles - Monitor is advertised for 178degrees, which is not entirely true. You can see as wide as 178degrees. But colours especially blacks and whites turn into greyish black and yellowish white, image(desktop wallpaper) quality really gets worse after about 40 degrees from centre, also the light spots due to backlight bleed really starts to show up at when you watch screen from the angle, However shockingly when watching movies, the viewing angles are much better, still can't be compared with an IPS panel viewing angles, which are way better than these. (This monitor has a VA panel)

Now for the pros, and why should you get it?
1. Deep Blacks - Oh my god, I loved the blacks of this screen, but only when viewing from the centre. This monitor has deep rich blacks than any IPS panel screen I have worked on. Blacks tend to get screwed up when viewing from the angle due to backlight bleed.
2. Curved screen - At this price point, this is the only curved screen in the market. Curved screen doesn't really matter for 24"" 16:9 monitor. It's not wide enough to really feel that immersive experience. Although aesthetically it does look pleasing, your family members or friends will get intrigued by seeing a curved screen. As a user, it didn't really matter to me. This one is subjective user to user.

My verdict, if you can live through backlight bleeding and weird colour reproducing when viewing through angles. This monitor produces really deep contrast images with vivid colours when viewing from the centre and it just might for you.

Professionals - I won't recommend for professionals or for office use. However, It will work for professional use if you work alone and doesn't really care about viewing angles. Still better if you go with an IPS panel monitor.

Hardcore gamers - I won't recommend for hardcore gaming too, No gaming monitor is made of VA panel. Do you wanna win a game or have a better contrast?

Casuals - Recommended for this category, this category is for people who wanna use for browsing, do some gaming but are not a hardcore gamer. Someone who watches a lot of movies. This might be the right one for you and a steal deal for the price you are getting compared to the rest of the market.

I returned the monitor because of the annoying backlight bleed issue."
Aman Mittal,Perfect 24-inch Monitor,"So I am a developer in a startup. I need to write a lot of code in online IDE or other VS Code. I was searching for a monitor which I could also use as a part time entertainment unit. This curved monitor is the perfect example of both worlds. I have very little space, so I went for 24 inches. Definitely go for 27 inches, if you have the space. Buy a good HDMI cable to avoid flickering. (ACTUALLY, ONE COMES IN THE BOX, but it's too small for me)

Connectivity:

1. Both HDMI & Analog are available. I use the HDMI display port as my laptop has one.

Setup:

1. Comes with a stand, setup guide and everything else in the box.
2. Comes with HDMI cable in the box.
3. Comes with Adapter in the box.

Configuration:
1. My Asus Laptop has AMD Radeon graphics with a Ryzen Processor. I am really lucky as FreeSync works perfectly out of the box with my laptop and it just has its own perks.

Display:

1. Well it works like a FHD Monitor with full specification. Do not compare with OLED.
2. Samsung panels are always great, and the curve of the screen seems futuristic.
3. I use a laptop which is Pantone Color Certified, with full OLED display - I have a very enhanced black color on my laptop with a faded one in the monitor. The crispiness is noticeable, but I end up using the monitor more than my laptop.

CONS: Though it comes with the support for an audio output through the 3.5 mm jack, but it does not have inbuilt speakers. If you need this and is a deal-breaker you can go with an LG one."
Shubham Aggarwal,Nice one.,"No inbuilt speaker & height adjustments.
Buyers pls aware about it.
Rest all really worth for money."
,Nice product,"It's good. The stand tilts the screen towards the ground though.

I wish the stand could be more 90 degrees facing upwards. The screen is fine. Let's see how it works going further.

Also no HDMI to USBC included with the monitor."
kinjal patel,Screen in this price range,
,GOOD PRODUCT,good product
Go Aawesome Venturz LLP,Good monitor under the price!,"1 star deducted just bcoz it doesnt have speakers, otherwise it is a good product for office work!"
Manali,I liked it. Worth to buy it.,"I used same monitor for more than 3 years.
I would say worth to buy it.
With it's border, easy to handle it and maintain it.

It has 1 HMI port only. Would suggest if 2 HMI could be better."
,Aaj 3 years sey upar hain,"4 ya fir aap kahi 10 years ye bas chalta hi rehta hain.....

Pure, sure n cure love this item"
Jayesh Panchal,Almost perfect!,"Hello! I received this monitor within 14 hours after placing the order, excellent job Amazon, thanks üññ

My current monitor is a Dell ST2420L, 5-yrs old, it started shutting off too frequently, tried couple of jugaads but, no results. Didn't want to spend time and money to get it fixed. Hence I began the new monitor hunt, a week of reading reviews of various monitors led me to this one.

Pros:
1. Excellent curve, few reviews mentioned the curve isn't noticeable but imho, it clearly is
2. Acceptable number of picture modes (standard mode easy on the eyes)
3. Super slim and light weight
4. Easily accessible HDMI, Power & VGA ports (have to research why VGA still lives)
5. Picture quality is superb and text is crisp & clear, better than in my old one
6. Joystick controller is pretty neat but not sure about it's longevity
7. Option to disable power LED, minor feature but very good

Cons:
1. Visible backlight bleeding (most annoying during dark movie scenes üò¢)
2. Viewing angles other than from front are terrible.

These two drawbacks, I guess can be overlooked due to the pros, and mainly because of the curve.

There is one visible dark dead pixel which I think is normal.

I have attached pictures that depict the backlight bleeding and viewing angle points mentioned above.

Will update, touchwood, if I come across any issues. Hopefully never.

Thank you, especially if you have read the entire review üëç

Update 08/08/2017:

A bright red dead pixel appeared on the screen. I have raised a request for replacement. Courier service missed picking up the package today. Amazon rep Arif S escalated the issue and promised me that the pickup will be done tomorrow, and that he will ensure the replacement unit reaches by 8PM tomorrow. He said he will call back tomorrow. Will update about the replacement unit after receiving it.

Update 10/8/2017: minus 2 stars due to below reasons

Never expected this from Amazon, a horrible experience. They missed picking up the package for 2 days. I had to talk to multiple reps who transferred my calls to multiple Leadership/Escalation Team reps, who escalated this issue 5 times already. Especially, one Arif S from Leadership Team promised the pickup of the monitor for 9/8/2017 as well as the delivery of replacement unit by end of the same day. Turns out he gave false information, according to another Escalation team rep Charan. As per him, replacement unit will be released only after the original unit is picked up. Also, the replacement, it seems, won't have the next day delivery like the original. Tried to get help from Amazon Social Media Team on Twitter but they too were unhelpful, to put it politely. Finally the pickup was done today afternoon. But the sad part is the replacement unit estimated delivery date is by 16/8/2017, which is totally absurd given that it was Amazon who delayed picking up the original unit. I've sent an email (7hrs ago) to Amazon describing the entire ordeal but nobody responded to it yet. It has been a frustrating past 3 days, total time spent on phone with Amazon reps has been over 3hrs, and neither any of the reps called back at least once to followup nor any of the reps tried to expedite the process of sending me the replacement unit. None of them took ownership.

Update 11/8/2017:

Received a call in the afternoon from an Executive Customer Relations Team rep in response to the email I sent yesterday. She apologized for the entire ordeal and showed empathy unlike the previous reps who just tried to butter up the conversation and washed off their hands from my issue. She said there is no way to expedite the delivery of the replacement order as it is already released and everything after that is automated. And I have to hope the package gets delivered sooner than estimated date since it's being shipped from within my city, Hyderabad. But I believe the courier would give least priority to this order because the guaranteed delivery date is by 16/8/2017, I told her this and I guess she understood. She gave me an assurance that they would listen to all my previous calls and provide appropriate feedback to the reps (every previous rep in my opinion) regarding the false info they provided and also for not taking ownership of the case. Upon my request, she agreed to call me back on Monday with any update, although she promised to keep an eye on this case and follow up accordingly.

Update 12/8/2017:

As per Amazon app, the package was dispatched today morning after 11AM. I emailed Amazon again with the tracking number requesting them to call the courier and expedite the delivery. Another rep from the Executive Customer Relations Team called me, I guess in response to the latest email. He said that the package has just arrived in my locality, and assured me that he will contact the courier to get the package delivered at the earliest."
govin tallang,Screen quality could be better,"Wasn‚Äôt expecting something exceptional in this price but the quality is really not 1080p and everything seems pixelated. The screen is not sharp and colors look faded.

One good thing is brightness is excellent. Form factor and curved display in such price makes it worth buying."
Kalyan Samineni,Excellent,Nice experience as its slightly circular.
,awesome,product is awesome
Shivani Narang,Awesome product.,This is fantastic product. Nothing worry about it.
Anutya Kondra,Quality,So good product under 8k
MUSAVVIR KAZI,Value of money... But one thing is missing... Speakers,Speakers is missing and ouput volume level is not good
Abhishek Nayak,Superb,
,Worth it at 6.6k,"Good Picture Clarity with True color. Not sure why Audio option is there in Menu while there is no inbuilt sound system.
Useless design for Wall Mount. I believe some idiot had designed that.
Let's see how long the VA panel will last."
SANTANU M.,Good delivery,Im very happy to buy Samsung products. Very good performance üëèüíØ
Sukhwant Singh Chana,Great Product,Nice Quality
Placeholder,quality,great product and good quality but the only con is its don't have c type slot
Piyush kumar,Works better than advertised!,"Many people seem to complain about bleeding and other things, when clearly it is not designed for that sort of functionality. It's simple physics, because of it's curvature, no matter how you look at it, the bezels WILL show this ""bleeding"" as they are emitting light for the display; and if you're going to buy this monitor for only pointing out this ""bleeding"" effect (unless its a defect) then I suggest you return this product and look elsewhere as this is the best price-to-performance gaming monitor out there.

Now for the review; this monitor is among the best 1080p monitors out there, especially for a 27"" display. The packaging is fairly simple and straightforward, with easy access to all the parts; however, please take care to remove the monitor last AFTER you have affixed the in-built stand, as it will be easier for handling and setting it up.

The joystick is precise and quite audible for a haptic interface, confirming each selection of the menu with a nice audible click. However, the menu options are a bit lacking, for example, when connected to my computer, I cannot adjust the brightness of the screen, nor do I get the option in the control panel; this is one of the reasons I reduced a star from the Overall rating (in case anyone else has a solution, please feel free to correct me). Apart from that, the EyeCare+ technology is good, increasing brightness while reducing the Blue spectrum to protect your eyes even at night but still provide a good gaming experience.

The assembly of the monitor is fairly easy, where you screw the base to the ""stem"" of the monitor stand, and can be done by hand; an excellent thinking on Samsung's part to provide a revolving handle on the screw for this purpose, you would've needed a Philips No 2 screw driver for the assembly otherwise.

Another negative feedback to Samsung however, is to include DVI cables instead of HDMI cables; almost all modern GPU's and motherboards now come with HDMI ports or Display Ports cables, while DVI cables are becoming redundant. Please start including the same, especially of you advertise it as a gaming monitor; such monitors will almost always be paired with a PC system dedicated for gaming, meaning it will have a discrete graphics card, and hence HDMI or Display ports.

Lastly, the display itself; the monitor has a very high refresh rate and when paired with an AMD graphics card, will give extremely smooth displays on the AMD FreeSync technology. Physically though, in case the viewing angle doesn't feel right, you can tilt monitor vertically, by pushing either the top of the display bezel or pulling it; please take care NOT to press the panel as it can damage the display, neither I, nor Samsung, will take responsibility if the tilting of the monitor is done incorrectly and ends up damaging the panel (this feature, rather strangely, is NOT given in the manual).

Finally, let the graphics software analyse the monitor and define the recommended display settings for the monitor, which usually sits at 1920x1080. In case you have discrete graphics, I would recommend leaving the recommended settings as it is."
Hamster Rhodes,Affordable,Best in this budget
Sohail,Good monitor for work.. Not for hard core gaming.,"A very good Samsung desktop monitor all is good...
Not for hardcore gaming. Bcuz it's only support 60hz max go to 75hz...
For work and essential it's good"
Amazon Customer,clear clarity,Nice performance
Sukesh,nice,nice product
Amazon Customer,"I HAVE NO COMPLAINT, IT WAS MY MISTAKE IN ORDERING DETAILS","I apologise for the inconvenience, but I ordered this Samsung Monitor by mistake. I need a bigger model, I will be happy, if you send me a 27"" model LC27R500FHWXXL. i SHALL BE HAPPY TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE OF RS. 3000/= , THRU MY AMAZON PAY ACCOUNT. I AM YOUR PRIME MEMBER FOR MORE THAN A DECADE, PLEASE BE A LITTLE FLEXIBLE FOR ME, I AM 72 YRS OLD SR. CITIZEN"
Placeholder,Nice clarity,Picture quality very nice for me.. no side glares. table mount not good... can't adjust. Can you please suggest good adjustable stand...
Vinay Kumar,Good,Working perfectly
Subhajit,I'm not saying it's bad.. it's just not suitable for everything,"Okay let's start off the things you shouldn't get it to do in it: Video rendering, Photo editing, Graphic designing, Programming or any kind of editing related to texts and visuals.
The things this is good for: Gaming and watching movies and for your entertainment purposes.

Just look at the first image (*sharpness is on 60). The text looks pixelated (your eyes will catch more than my camera did) and it becomes hard to read the small texts. Obviously a 15'' 1080p display would look good but when you pack those pixels in a larger 24'' display, you're gonna get more jagged edges. The pictures look fine but if you're looking at the tiny ones (e.g. a youtube thumbnails), you'll notice how grainy they are.

It's hasn't even been 2 month and yet I got a dead (or stuck) pixel and the HDMI port stopped working. Now, I'm stuck with the VGA. I will claim the warranty and get it checked off! Edit: HDMI port wasn't faulty, the cable was. Also, using a premium quality cable drastically improves the picture quality and sharpness!

It does have tilt! People who are saying this can't be tilted, must look at the fourth picture. Just apply some force to the upwards and it will tilt!

Some users are complaining about the bleeding issue (from the sides) and the bad viewing angles. But they must know before buying this is that it is a VA panel (clearly mentioned in title, isn't it?) and VA panels are all about the center & single-person things. So if you're buying one, then you must know that you are buying it for yourself and not for the person looking at your monitor from the side. But these panels tend to have good color productions (not as IPS though) but it doesn't seem to be with this monitor. With some tweaks I somehow managed some fixes for the yellowish tint and washed out colors:
(I have my brightness on 30)
- Set the sharpness to 60/63 and the contrast to 75. (If isn't already)
- Go to the Color and set the gamma to Mode3, Red to 43, Green to 45 and the Blue to 52. This will produce more vibrant colors and fix the yellowish tint.
- *Keep the Samsung Upscale turned off, it certainly drops the image quality and increases sharpness.
- Choose the response time as fastest (optional).
And adjust the tilt and make it more centered, so the bad viewing angles won't bother you.
If you're planning to buy it just to game and watch movies, you can go for it. 27'' model would be better, because you will less notice the curve from the middle in the smaller one. A 24 inch monitor with curve is straight up a gimmick!
But if it's not for your entertainment purposes, then I'd recommend you to go with the LG's 22'' IPS monitor (priced same as this one on Amazon). The larger screen and curve must not allure you, a large monitor will only look sharp and good if it's at least 1440p and having an IPS panel."
,Satisfied,Good product! Value for money.
Shaila Keni,Good product,Positive
Shyam,Best budget monitor for day to day activities,"No doubt it is the best monitor in this budget. Only two thing are missing from my point of view. 1. USB ports. 2. Adjustable hight and tilt.
Other than these two, I am really happy with this monitor and I highly recommend to others as well who are looking for a budget monitor with excellent picture quality."
S. G.,Good value,"Great product, I bought this at 9500 but the price went down.
The only issues I found was that the stand was a little hard to attach assemble and dsub vga only supports 60hz at 1080p on my pc.
Everything else was great.

It has amazing contrast and the blacks are so beautiful."
Bht choti h mere bete 15month ki h vo be bht muskil se beth pati h,Sound belcul b nhi,Good
sriteja jeedigunta,"Not for editors, photographers or gamers.","I needed an extended full HD monitor for editing and music composition purposes. And to avail the comfort of not tilting my head much, I opted for the Samsung monitor.

Initially I received a faulty product, which did not turn on at all.
I reported that to customer service and in literally 24 hours, ie the next day morning I had a replacement waiting at my door step.
Great service by Amazon.

The installation is super easy. The instruction manual is pretty self explanatory. And the replacement monitor worked like a charm..

I had used the monitor for a little over two months I guess and here are the pros and cons and my observations.

Suitable for editing ? : NO. Take a hard pass there.

Suitable for work from home? : Oh yeah baby!

Suitable for music production? : Definitely

Suitable for casual browsing and media consumption? - Sure !

How is the quality - The high definition videos Play great if you sit in front of the screen. The detail is there. Absolutely great for media consumption.

Colors ? - This is where the problem is. As I said, not for editors or photographers. I tried all combinations of screen adjustments. Big no. Absolutely perfect for general population. Not for film technicians.

Viewing angle? - average to be honest. I am the type of guy who sits in front of the PC, so it's cool for me. But if you view from left or right, you see the sceen is almost faded and whitish.

Surface? - The back of the monitor is fragile and perhaps made of bad plastic. Gotta handle with care or the board may get damaged. Weight of the device is less.

Good for gaming? - naah ! I'm not a gamer. Yet I can say it's not for gaming.

Finally, good for work from home, media consumption & reading.

Not for gaming, editing or photography editing."
Ajay kumar sharma,Review,Nice product sure go for itt
Deepti,Great product and timely,"Great product And timely delivered. Amazon is a Great Company, we all Indian Indians have to learn alot from them. We are still far behind them."
Amazon Customer,Average,"Sonund Quality is not Good
Brightness Good"
Abinav,Good for work and programming,I use the monitor primarily for work and find it quite satisfactory
Placeholder,Good one,"I purchased 27 inch one around 14k. Reviewing after using it for almost 3 years. I can say for the price it's the best product.
Though you will see light bleeding in black backgrounds at the edges."
Gokul,Display issue within one month.,"I bought this product on 8th September and on 2nd October a line appered on the centre of the screen. Not even survived one month. Never expected this from a brand like Samsung.Really pathetic.

*** update*** not sure how, but very next day it disappeared."
,After 3 weeks from purchase...OK!,"We received this product but it was not sealed at all, seems to be open box and sold like that, one disadvantage is cannot scale up or down stand so only option is to use VESA stand. After using for 3 weeks,sounds fine and no issue observed...all is well, three-star for not sending in ""sealed""..."
