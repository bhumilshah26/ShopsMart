Harish G,Sturdy and user friendly,Quality is good
Sukriti Sharma,"Perfect screen guard, perfect installation","This is the best tempered screen guard Iâ€™ve ever installed on my iPhone. Comes in great protective packing, with a useful cleaning kit that has an alcohol wipe, cloth wipe and de-dusting sticker for those pesky little dust particles. Installation instructions are useful, and there are also guiding stickers to help with alignment (though I didnâ€™t use these). The screen guard fit the screen perfectly and the adhesive automatically spread edge-to-edge by pressing on the centre. No air bubbles, no gaps. Perfect installation and great touch sensitivity. Thank you OpenTech, keep it up, all the best! ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ"
Amazon Customer,"No hype, its just a normal screen protector without curved edges","Screen protector looks good. Touch response is also good. But lacks in 2.5D edges as mentioned. Because of this it looks normal screen protector and not a premium screen protector. The edges are harsh to touch and price also high, which would get the same quality product around 150 rupees in offline stores."
Ankit,Bestest best Screen Guard and after service promise,"Packing: 10/10. For reaching to Screen guard you have to open two paper box cover and one foam cover. So for me best packing.
Cleaning material: 10/10. I found one wet tissue(alcohol), one dry tissue and a sticker for removing dust. I used only wet and dry tissue. They are totally able to clean the screen.
Screen Guard: 10/10. Nice curved from for side. Nice transparency.
Adhesion process: 10/10. Very very very easy. Jst remove back sheet. Place it on phone and drop it. Automatically Screen guard takes it's place. If any buble comes jst press or rub the screen with dry tissue. In my case air fully comes out.
After Service promise: This screen guard comes with 3 months warranty and life time support. The product comes with a letter of promise for life time support and 24 hrs resolve. This is very impressive.

So, in future if I buy any Screen guard I will definitely by from this brand. If I recommend any one definitely I will recommend this brand."
,"Product is good, with small issue","The product is good, only issue is, whicle talking on cell phone, when you bring the phone away from ear, the screen still remains black, you have to click on any physical button to wake up the screen (to cancel the call or to do any other operation)"
Vinay r.,Worth the money,"The order which I received was awesome but it was not sticking well at one edge but I used the warranty option ., and as promised I got an instant response from the team saying that I will receive a replacement product ., the next day itself they ordered the replacement product to me for zero cost ., thank you so much for the team in quick and customer friendly service ., You can go for this product without any doubt ., Best service and amazing quality product.,"
karthika,Good tempered glass and easy to install without any bubbles,"Good glass and it was easy to install. Infact since iphone6 is smaller in size I didn't use the guide stickers which are provided in the packing. I took out the old tempered glass and cleaned the phone properly by using anti bacterial wet wipes. Cleaned again with a tissue paper. Then only I used the wet wipe and tissue provided by the company. This way the phone got cleared from all old glue etc and the stickiness on the surface of the original glass was gone. For sticking the tempered glass, I took off the back sticker, taking care not to touch the inside or the sticky side of the tempered glass and aligned it over the phone and slowly dropped it on the phone original glass. Unlike other tempered glass this one just got stuck with minimal bubbles which when pressed to the side vanished. The whole process of sticking was easy. Infact the cleaning process is where one should take extra care because any old residue or dirt can cause bubbles. For those sticking for the first time watch youtube videos to get an idea. Overall I am really satisfied with this product."
Bobby,Worth buying,Protects screen.
,Not durable,Not even a month and the tempered glass is breaking from the corners.
Amazon Customer,Young startup,"My screen guard got cracked with in couple of days. I emailed them and they sent me a new screen guard. All they asked for was a good review on amazon if possible, as they are a young startup run by first time entrepreneurs. Thankyou very much guys, loved your product, good luck for your future endeavours."
Kindle Customerz,Great Product & great service,"I have been an amazon customer last several years and this is my first review here. I must say that the Screen protector I received from OpenTech is outstanding in quality. I just installed it today so I cannot make any comment on the durability yet until I use it for a few months at least. But I can certainly vouch that you get the feeling of a premium product by it's look, design and comfort in using it on your iPhone screen. I can't thank you enough for their outstanding customer service. I got a wrong product delivered on Sunday and immediately sent a note to the OpenTech customer care team. To my surprise, I got a call on Sunday night itself and I was promised that I will receive a call from customer care next day by 2pm. As promised I received a call on Monday by 2 Pm and the customer care team helped me to place a new request without any extra cost. The new order got delivered yesterday. Thank you OpenTech"
Musaddiq Ali,"As expected, the tempered glass was good for my iPhone 6S","Everything was fine, but the manufacturer should also include an instruction guide for the people who install the tempered glass themselves for the first time, because for me, even though I have installed tempered glass before myself a couple of times, I had no clue what was the use of the Guide Stickers. So for that, I had to watch a YouTube video. Also, if possible, the thin glass or the plastic sheet attached with the tempered glass (which is to be removed before applying) should have cutouts in the home button area as well as the earpiece area at the top, so that the user can see and align the tempered glass before sticking the guide stickers. Or, maybe if no cutouts, then just avoid the graphics (maybe minimal graphics) on that plastic sheet and keep it transparent, that will also do. Thanks."
vikas kumar,"Excellent product, and even better customer service.","Very good product. Was extremely easy to apply and looks very sturdy. Excellent finishing.5 start rating.
I'd also give 5 stars for customer service.i had accidently ordered a front screen only Protector, whereas i wanted an edge to edge one. The product was not returnable, so i mailed their customer care. I got a reply within 30 minutes! Next day i was given a call and assured that they will refund my amount if i placed an order for an edge to edge(which is anyway what i wanted)- they didn't even ask for return of the earlier product. This is an example of excellent customer service where they are looking out for customer interest first. And this is what is needed in Indian startups.Way to go."
Amit Nikam,This is my second purchase and the product is awesome!,"- Came well packaged
- Installation process was printed on the box and was easy to follow
- Best part is, you just place the cover on the screen and put a finger in the middle and the adhesive spreads and sticks itself to the entire screen gradually.

Edit: 22Dec2021
My son threw the phone and this screenguard took a hit. It saved my phone's screen without a single scratch on it. Thanks!

Would 100% recommend this product."

yashwanth patta,Easy to install and most importantly easy to correct,"Adhesion is good. Exact fit to 6s. I applied the tempered glass with misalignment and incorrectly a couple of times but there were no issues in removing the glass immediately off the screen and realigning properly. Touch screen feels smooth

The steps and guide were missing in my package but I was able to reference on amazon luckily."
,Excellent packing and excellent product,"Their packing is very good as the screen guard is a delicate product. Their gesture and thanking the customer for purchasing their product is very good.
The product quality is very good. The instructions are clear that makes the installation easy.
Thank You OpenTech."
Placeholder,Worth it,"Product good. Have jus installed it yesterday. So functionality wise will update as I use it. Installation was pretty easy. Packing was excellent and classy. Liked the made in India part. Felt good that something nice and prime was our making. Overall good but will update on usage. Thank you

Manoj Ganji,Amazing customer service,Such an awesome customer service. Itz been 3 months i had been using it and accidentally broke it on a fall! Since they are already known for the customer service.. juz contacted them and i am kinda amazed by the response. Their mail response was so fast and soon connected on call nd in a week i got these two new screen protectors for just 99. I would blindly go for it next time nd confidently suggest to friends!
Amazon Customer,Best Product. You can go for it.,"1. Package is Good & Delivered on Time.
2. Cleaning materials inside the pack, do the job perfectly.
3. Curved Glass display exactly matching with the Mobile screen and display area.
4. Home screen buttons, camera notch are perfectly cut.
5. Sticking of glue done automatically without any bubbles, applied very soft.
6. Display is very crystal clear, no difference in touch sensitivity.

Overall, its a very good product.

One Remark:
Applying the glass on the screen was somewhat tricky. If they find any good solution for applying the glass, would value addition."
D. Dhiwakar,"Easy to use, very good quality","This is my second purchase as the first one was damaged when I dropped my phone.
I looked for this product and purchased it as this is very easy to install and kept my iPhone screen well protected.
Will definitely recommend this product, even a first time user can use it with ease and costs less than half as they would charge in a shop."
Suhana pandey,"Amazing product, durable and easy to install","It was perfect. I want to mention that I didnâ€™t get the dry tissue mentioned but it was fine; had some at home plus the cloth did the job.
Pls check your phoneâ€™s back cover before purchasing and donâ€™t get it if you have a big back cover/ phone case"
Syed,It is an awesome product i have seen so far with my 15 years of iphone experience,It is an awesome product i have seen so far with my 15 years of iphone experience
Shaik h.,Excellent Quality,"I went to offline store asked him for iPhone 6s tampered glass. He charged 799/- for a Chinese product as per MRP. However this product I have ordered infront of that guy at 399/- + its an amazon choice product. So no doubt about itâ€™s quality and timely delivery. I have ordered and here we go. Overall I can give 5 stars for speed delivery, quality and design. Now my phone looking beautiful than before. Thanks Amazon. Thanks open tech."
,Good Product,"This is a good product and they need to adjust little bit home button round to get exactly iphone 6.
But it is ok, so I gave 4 star."
Shaji,Quality product,"So far the best screen guard I have used. It was very easy to fix, and good result (touch and response). Just a word of caution, try to fix this indoors and ensure that your fan is not on. Wipe the surface really clean before you apply the guard.

For product it is 5/5 rating.
For amazon delivery 3/5 (Prompt on delivery, but too much wastage on packing. If this continues, Amazon should think for an option to take back the packaging to reuse)"
Sudeep,Donâ€™t buy as it is not worth for Rs350,"I am writing this review after 2 months of use.
The screen guard was broken within first 15 days from corners.
The service of this guard is similar to Rs50 screen which I installed from local shop.
I thought this would be a perfect screen guard for my iPhone since it is of Rs350.

Usually I do not write review but this one made me to do soâ€¦
Itâ€™s a big no if you are planning to buy"
,Fantastic Product for iPhone 6!!!,The whole package is done with great care and passion..proud of an Indian Company delivering such high standards!!The Glass is edge to edge for my iPhone 6 and fits perfectly to the T!!!. This is my third purchase from OpenTech ( earlier it was for a Samsung M21 and One Plus 5T in family )and extremely delighted with the service and quality of the product ...that too at a Great Price !!
Placeholder,Product is overpriced for its quality,This product is overpriced with the box packaging. Same product without box package available for 150 in the market. Tempered glass is not that much sturdy..
Ravi Krishnan,Excellent product,"Adhesive in GuideSticker was not good enough to hold the glass while removing the screenguard. Other than this, everything else is perfect. The product has professional packaging. The guard just glued to the screen and worth the money."
Vivek Chandrasekaran,awed by the product..first time felt that screen guard was so easy to install without bubbles...,awed by the product..first time felt that screen guard was so easy to install without bubbles...become a fan of opentech ..i am going to order all my futureb screen guards from you opentech
mayumi fukawa,Excellent service,"I purchased OpenTech tempered glass screen, was satisfied for all for the quality itself,description and well packing.

After 6weeks, I recognized that the glass screen has cracks without falling down or impact, so I just contacted with the service center where gave me an excellent support.

Thank you for your professional service, I definitely will come back for shopping again!"
Madhuri Reddy,Good product.,It was easy to install and fits the screen completely.
Vivek Gupta,Excellent product,"The product was excellent and it fits right onto your iPhone you wouldnâ€™t notice that that there is a tempered glass on your phone.

,Amazing product. Easy to install and Product exceed expectations,"I never had good experience with online screen protector purchase.

This vendor is completely different in all aspects in product delivery, product packaging and good part is clear information with installation kit for screen protector installation.

I never feel like you guys are startup while using screen protector product. But then I found one of your pamphlet inside package.

Keep it up good work guys. 5 stars for this product."
Sudhir Parab,Worth the buy!,"Such an amazing product!
Loved the cards present in the package...it really meant they value customer satisfaction.
Just did the process....the glass was awesome..no damages...jus a 3-4 pockets of air bubbles around the corner....which is totally okay as it is my first time doing it by myself.
Hope it is durable during time...and I'll make sure to update the status later!"
Sayan,Outstanding Quality,"Using the product for 3 weeks. Amazing performance. in between this time i dropped my phone three times. mostly from my work table to ground. Even it fell on road from my pocket while riding a bike (although not a very high speed). No shattering, not even got a visible scratch. Great product. Although high price still it justifies its price"
rapchick,Super product,The product was awesome quality it was fixed properly this brand is far more better than some expensive brands you can buy this product without any hesitation.
Vijayalakshmi,Excellent product close your eyes and go for it,Excellent self kit. Worth the price and quality. But must check the tempered while receiving itself it consists of lot of dust particles which is hard for me to undust it.
,A quality and stylish product,Well packed. One of the good quality screen guard I have ever bought. Happy purchase. Keep up the good work Open tech team.
Joy ratchal,More than expectations,I am satisfied with the product. Touch screen is like silky smooth. Doesnâ€™t spot finger-print or oily-spot onto it. OpenTech is really good.
Sumit Das,"Screen quality is not good, cracked within 10 days","Quality of screen is not expected level, its got cracked in 10 days, guarantee of screen is for 3 months,it is under guarantee period now and should be replaced by saler..photo of cracked screen uploaded."
Ashok Wankhede,Great quality,"Phone display looks so good. Covers the entire phone screen and has good installation. It glued to my phone in the first go without having to push the bubbles, bubbles hardly formed and went away on its own in seconds."
,NOT easy to apply,"It is not easy to apply it! Yes, the manufacturer gives each and every step to apply it but if you are not good at this please do not give a try!"
Bipasha Mistry,Certainly give it a try!,The effort they put in manufacturing this is commendable at just 139 INR. The white screen protector Looks good! Both the texture and the touch are of good quality. Should see how long this lasts! But appreciate the efforts put by OpenTech.
Meenakshi Gupta,Quite good screen protector,"Using it for 3 days, its very nice. It fits well at the Edges and also it is like feather touch. The glass Looks quite sturdy. Overall i am satisfied. Will give more feedback after using for few months"
