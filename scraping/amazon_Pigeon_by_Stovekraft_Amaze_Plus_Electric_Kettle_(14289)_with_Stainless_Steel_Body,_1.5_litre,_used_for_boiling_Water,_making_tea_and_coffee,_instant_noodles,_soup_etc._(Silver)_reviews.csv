Amazon Customer,"Simple, Efficient, and Easy-Clean, with a Minor Pouring Quirk","If you're looking for a no-frills, reliable kettle, the Pigeon kettle is a solid choice. Here's my breakdown:

Pros:
Simple and User-Friendly: This kettle is incredibly easy to use, with just one switch to operate. Even someone unfamiliar with kettles will have no trouble figuring it out.
Fast Boiling: It delivers on its promise, boiling water in a speedy 10 seconds, perfect for those mornings when you need a quick cup of tea or coffee.
Easy Cleaning: The kettle's design makes cleaning a breeze. No complex nooks or crannies to tackle, just a quick wipe-down is all it takes.

Cons:
Minor Pouring Control: While not a deal-breaker, the pouring mouth could be a little more predictable. Sometimes, especially when dealing with the last bit of water, it can be tricky to control the flow, leading to potential spills.

Overall:
Despite the minor pouring quirk, the Pigeon kettle excels in its simplicity, efficiency, and ease of cleaning. If you prioritize these aspects in a kettle and don't mind a slightly less controlled pour, this is a great option to consider."
Havika Apang,Convenient but not long living,I had bought this product before and it got bad in a year. The lifespan of this product is not great but it is good to use for shorterm situations and it‚Äôs cheap.
Praveen Kumar Singh,Cord length is short,The product is good. Does the job well. The outer body gets warm so be careful when you're touching it. The mouth of the kettle was leaking then I got it replaced. I do not have the same problem now. The cord length is short if you want to keep it still in a place then you might look for a longer cord kettle.
Vivek Garg,Average Product,The lower machine gets faulty after few months.. Though got repaired.
Naveen Todi,Good product,"After using it for one month I can say the product is really good ,heats up really fast ,the only problem with this kettle is that outlet from where we pour water is very broad and hence home for dusts"
Amazon Customer,"Faulty product, leakage","I received this product yesterday and tried it out, this morning I found water at the base, leading me to check, there is a, trickle of water leakage at the bottom, due to which water accumulates at base. Attaching pictures. Please suggest return of product."
,Good product. Heats water quick,Product is very good. Heating water in just 2 minutes. Worth for money. Only dislike is the metal part is also hot when water is hot. Only the handle is not obsorbing the heat.

jigyasa sharma,No latch to hold lid but great price point,"For its price point,it's great, but it's difficult to keep the lid open when you are pouring water into it.You need to basically hold the lid and then let it fill up.This is honestly very irritating, and I would have loved it if it had something to hold the latch.Otherwise, you can buy."
Shiny,Need Amazon to focus if the product has warenty,"Sir it was useful for 3,4 times after that when ever I plug it our power supply dropping inverter sounds a lot if I plug out we r able to get the electricity back again. So I stopped using it . I have warenty please proceed sir / ma'am."
