Mahesh,Best in Price range,"Writting this review after using for a month :-

Best design and build quality you can buy as it contains ssd which gives best performance for an day to day life and charging last for upto 4 hrs and also best in preformnce.

Can buy this laptop for an day to day user and"
,Value for money,Good performance but speaker low volume and camera less quality
Gurmukh Singh,TN display is not good for eyes.,"Performance wise really great laptop but if you are going for a TN display then it becomes really painful to look at the laptop. If you are planning to spend a good number of hours with a laptop working on it then I believe it will impact the eyesight because the colours look washed out in TN display even if you try setting up various display brightness levels it won't look good. You need to sit and look from an exact angle to get the property visibility. Don't expect any good results if you are looking at the screen from angle more than 30 degree. From the left, it will look too bright white and from the right, you will see too dark black. Lenovo has given both TN and IPS displays - TN display is for low-budget laptops and IPS for a higher budget. Lenovo has clearly mentioned it is TN display so it is general characteristics of the TN display to work like that and it does not provide good viewing angles in general.

Also, speaker's sound is not that great.

Performance wise this is a great laptop - no fan sound very silent operation and all the applications program runs smoothly without any issues.

TN Screen displays 2 out of 5. (go for IPS version)
Speaker sounds 2 out of 5.

In nutshell, it is a low budget laptop with a main focus on performance with an average display and speaker but with great processor power and RAM."
Sunil,Not a good laptop and irresponsible Customer Support,"I bought this laptop for my son. He is studying in Thapar Engineering College, Patiala. I purchased this for his studies. Since the purchase, the laptop stopped working twice. The laptop would suddenly refuse to boot and one or two screws on the back side would loosen up. The 1st problem happened within one week of purchasing the laptop. After raising the request, the executives would come and fix it along with the screws.
Now the same problem has happened the 3rd time and laptop refuses to boot. Even after raising multiple requests, the customer support says that he has to physically visit the center despite laptop being covered in On Site warranty. The nearest center from his college is in the city of Chandigarh.
Very irresponsible customer support."
Abhinav Vaid,Nice laptop,"Very nice laptop. Worthy for the price. Only con is predated warranty, instead of 24 months it shows 17 months warranty. Amazon took back the laptop when I asked about it."
Placeholder,Decent good old all rounder laptop for college students,"I got this laptop for 54k, for which it is a decent deal. The best thing about it is that it is an overall well rounded machine. It is well built and looks good, is sufficiently thin and light, has a modern and fast processor (for day to day purposes, not including gaming and related stuff), boots within 10 seconds and wakes up in about a second, and has some decent speakers too.

Biggest Con for me would be the display; the 8 GB variant comes with an IPS display, which should be available with the 16GB as well (I have the latter). Darker colors look a little meh, maybe it could be a deal breaker if that's your priority. No fingerprint sensor and single level backlit keyboard are another couple of misses, which should be offered (some competitors do).

Overall, as a college student, this is a satisfactory purchase for me. It's the kind of deal that you can't go wrong with, no nonsense reliable product with a great warranty package. Although the prices have increased since, and I'm not sure I can recommend it at >4k more than what I purchased it at (54k).
*Update after two months usage: The display is actually the weakest part of this laptop. Studying in a college pursuing CS, I am around all sorts of laptops, and it is very apparent among all the better screens. Otherwise the device works just fine in all other respects, the battery could've offered a wee bit more charge but it's alright."
Rahul,Good Laptop. But I doubt about service and warranty,"1. though I am a prime customer, delivery was delayed 4 days than promised.
2. No Technician visit will happen, during the return period. so better to return or go for a refund if any issues during that period.
3. Game Pass - forget about it. no one knows anything about it.

coming to laptop:
performance is good. The battery back is little poor only I can say. if you do not put it on the stand it will get heated up. you need to put it on a stand while using it.
I see charged adapter is also very hot than usual. not sure why."
,Good product,Great experience.
Praveen Uppala,......,Everything is good.but i think it is give proper battery backup i.e mentioned...
naim shaikh,Go for it,
sagar s.,Camera and sound,"Camera and sound of this laptop is below average. Other than this, everything is good"
Saurabh,Ok,"Lower built quality. Poor display. Can not play game like HALO.
SURFACE is dust magnate."
Abu H.,Defective waranty period,"Warranty period shown on the machine is from date of manufacture and not the date of purchase. Correction of date of purchase is again very painful. Buggy app create error while submitting. The form is not designed to get all the documents required like proof of Serial number, Machine Type Model. You need to submit these documents via emai, after you get 1st response via mail."
abhilash,Sound issue,Everything else in this laptop was good but the sound output is bad had to use headset always to hear properly
vivek singh bisht,Feedback,Speed is good but screen quality is very poor.
The Laptop I got its screen is blinking. So I had a little trouble ðŸ˜ž then I go for exchange,Check your laptop properly,"Laptop build quality and keyboard is very good but I found blinking screen
laptop."
Shreyosi B.,Works like promised,Not really anti glare but the battery does live up to thr 6hr claim if u optimise it and keep the battery saver on.
,Worst experience don't buy laptop this model and seller,"Laptop came with charging issue. Raided complaint on same day. They said technical person will come and check product, but no one came to check and updated status as working fine again spoken with customer care and they said will take action on that.... . After 48hrs amazon raised for replacement for product, then after 4 days delivery person came to deliver the product.... but bit drama there he mentioned that there is no physical damage so i won't take product. I am shocked I have not mentioned any where physical damage. Finally he canceled the product. This is worst experience spoken with customer care(Amazon) but no use sorry sir we are not able to deliver again. Need to pickup old one then we will provide refund amount. 11days waiting period,money and time wasted. Please don't buy laptop."
veeraprathap,Battery issues,Be cautious while procuring laptops online when prices are slashed. Battery issues are faced n no proper response from Lenovo team
Placeholder,Regretful decision,Not at all happy with the product. Within one month it started having speaker issues. It's been about 7 months now and it has started having so many issues. It switches off automatically...gets heated quickly. One cannot buy laptops every sid month. The customer service provider was also very very rude. I had raised online tickets but they kept dilly dallying. I am frustrated and broke after buying it. Biggest regret.
Prasad,Nice laptop for daily use,"I wanted a fast laptop for my personal use. This laptop fulfilled all my needs, This is great buy at this price. i5 12th gen CPU and 16 GB memory along with SSD drive makes this laptop work faster.

Only negative point is battery. It could have been better. Backup is just 2-2.5 hours even for new device.

But overall at 57k this was a good deal."
Pritha Tyagi,Not that great,"The laptop's keyboard is unreadable in case of certain lighting conditions. Charger gets heat up so fast. Poor battery life, just 2 hours, key came off within 7 days. Only good part was processor i5 and RAM 16GB. That is all. Apart from that laptop quality is not that great."
sai praneeth,good and cool,"its good one thing is its full of plastic body if you want to go for metal then same laptop available in ideapad slim 5 10k more than this product price, and who wants Separate (dedicated) graphics card then its not a choice, but overall performance is good and fast
you can run at a time 10 to 20 applications"
Rejith M,Very good,The fastness and itâ€™s performance when multiple applications are opened seems really good.Bought this for studying purposes and it serves well so far.
Syammie,No heat problems with this 12Gen unit,"Compared to my other i7 11Gen, this 12th Gen Laptop does better in terms of heat emissions. Performance is Okay. Going good with SSD. No harm for a student life."
Sreekanth Gorantla,Only for school or college students. Do not waste your money.,"This is not for a working people. Only for school or college students. Not for Developers. Ideapad is a very lower end laptop and doesn't useful for a working people. DO NOT BUY any Lenovo Ideapad laptops if you are working person.
Pro's:
Laptop is auto startup and it takes less than 30 sec's.
as it is new battery coming for 5 to 6 hrs.

CON's:

NOT FOR WORKING PEOPLE.
NOT FOR DEVELOPERS.

Colors are very dull. Screen is not LCD. It is a very basic screen like 2000's laptops.

Amazon is not even allowing to return and taking a new product.

So do not waste your money."
,It's nice product,Nice look
Shubham Saraf,Think twice before you purchase,Iâ€™m not a great fan of this laptop because battery sucks. It takes so much time for the laptop to get charged and it takes 30 40 mins for the battery to get drained. I got battery issue in just 4 months after buying the laptop. I had to take to the service center and got the battery exchanged after a week. Donâ€™t buy Lenovo go for HP value for money
Dinesh,Ok for work laptop,"Performance is Evo level like display turns on as soon as leed is opened. beside, performance everything is big mess. Display is not very good,anti reflective coating is of bad quality it meshed with display quality. 60 Hz display in this time feels very bad to work with. On top of that colours look bad and the marketed 300nits is a lie, my hp laptop with 250 nits looks brighter.Keyboard is okay-ish. speaker is very bad,bass is non existent. Body plastic is of good quality.but, bottom plastic is like brought from 30k laptop. You can buy if it's your first laptop."
Anmol Kumar Verma,performance,Excellent performance worth the money
Amazon Customer,Liked it,Good for students
Sai sandeep,Value for money,Value for money
Sunil Agrawal,Office 2021 & Mcafee Antivirus stopped working within 6 months after purchase,"The product was purchased in July 2023 with Office 2021 & McAfee Antivirus pre-installed. However, within 6 months after purchase both Office 2021 & Mcafee have stopped working and I am unable to use the laptop for any meaningful purpose."
Ashok,Excellent product,Excellent product
Placeholder,Warranty and bad display quality and battery backup,"Display is worst and poor battery backup and due to a mistake of missing the laptop serial number on the invoice and p slip,to solve this not an easy task . As serial number is missed the warranty also not changed to start from purchase date ."
Meghana,Not bad,Batter backup isn't that great however other features are fine
Mayank singh gautam,Great package,"Great choice, i totally loved it.
Worth for money."
Placeholder,"Worst laptop, don't buy",Battery life gets 1 hour after 6 months. Outdated and slow laptop. The speaker glitches a lot. This pc cannot do even simole processes. Not at all recommended
Aditya,Good,Verry nice
Sivam,Good product,It is bundled with OS and MSoffice great value for the money invested.
Belman Flexibles India Pvt Ltd,Good Product,Very Good Performance
Sudheer,Defective laptop and no solution,I have ordered one laptop Lenovo IdeaPad i5 . It is defective laptop display was not opened. Totally black display. But there is no proper solution for this. They said 3 to 4days will solve but there is no solution
Amazon Customer,"Product Horrible! Crashing pages, illegible text, outdated Intel graphics.","I strongly advise against purchasing this product. It is incredibly disappointing and riddled with numerous issues. The pages continuously crash, making it extremely frustrating to use. Moreover, the text color is illegible, causing strain on the eyes and making it difficult to read. Additionally, the graphics are powered by an outdated Intel graphics processor, which severely hampers the overall visual experience.

I highly recommend considering an alternative product that features an NVIDIA graphics processor instead. Despite potentially requiring a slightly higher investment, it is undoubtedly worth it. Opting for a product with NVIDIA graphics ensures better performance, enhanced visuals, and a significantly improved user experience"
Ayush Baliyan,"Overall good product ,Go for it .",
,The laptop is not starting,"Laptop fails to start canâ€™t see the screen need to replace a brand bed laptop
Itâ€™s been a month and no one has picked up the laptop"
Placeholder,Overall decent performance and noce built quality.,Only 2 usb port.
,Superb processing capability,"Only best part of the laptop is Intel 12th gen , hybrid processor. This ultra responsive, fast and smooth in executing the applications. Better display could have chosen for the price range."
Dishank,Old laptop given in the name of new,Given an old n used laptop in the name of new. The bios update date is 1 yr old. Warranty on lenovo website shows 6 months lapsed event hough I received laptop today. How can 6 months be lapsed in warranty the day of purchase. It is clearly a used laptop. Did not expect such cheapness from Amazon.
sridhar,No support from amazon,"No help from amazon as the product is defective
I have approached consumer forum"
Raunak Kumar Gupta,Scam company,"Gatiya company hai lenovo
Only scams
Mena ja laptop liya slim 3
Aur 8 din k ander display kharab ho gaya aur jab customer care ma call kiya replacement k liya too 5 din k baad aya reply ki nii hoga replace jayo
