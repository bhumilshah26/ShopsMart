Gaurav Gupta,Camera Beast,"The Samsung Galaxy A14 5G is a budget-friendly smartphone that offers a decent mix of features and performance. It has a 6.6-inch 1080p LCD display with a 90Hz refresh rate, a MediaTek Dimensity 700 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a 50MP rear camera, a 13MP front camera, and a 5,000mAh battery.

The Galaxy A14 5G is a good choice for people who are looking for a basic smartphone with 5G connectivity. It's not the fastest phone on the market, but it's fast enough for most tasks. The display is sharp and vibrant, and the 90Hz refresh rate makes scrolling and animations feel smooth. The battery life is also excellent, and the phone can easily last a full day on a single charge.

The camera is one of the weaker points of the Galaxy A14 5G. The main camera takes decent photos in good lighting, but the quality drops off significantly in low light. The front camera is also a bit underwhelming.

Overall, the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G is a good budget-friendly smartphone with 5G connectivity. It's not the best phone on the market, but it offers a good value for the price.

Here are some of the pros and cons of the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G:

Pros:

5G connectivity
Sharp and vibrant display
90Hz refresh rate
Long battery life
Affordable price
Cons:

Camera is not great in low light
Front camera is a bit underwhelming
Performance can be a bit slow at times
If you're looking for a basic smartphone with 5G connectivity, the Samsung Galaxy A14 5G is a good option. However, if you're looking for a phone with a great camera or top-of-the-line performance, you'll want to look elsewhere.

deepak mishra,Display sharpness not good,"Urgent: A14 5G Display Quality Concerns Compared to Competitor's Device

Dear Samsung Customer Support,

I hope this message reaches you promptly. I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the display quality of my recently purchased Samsung A14 5G smartphone. As a dedicated Samsung user, it pains me to report that the display on my A14 5G does not meet the expected standards, especially when compared to a competitor's device, the Redmi 12C.

Upon extensive testing, I have observed that the A14 5G's display fails to produce sharp images, notably when streaming YouTube videos. Surprisingly, the Redmi 12C, a device from a different brand, consistently delivers a crisper and more vibrant visual experience.

I have ensured that all software and applications are up to date on my Samsung device, and I've taken various measures to optimize the display settings. However, the disparity in image sharpness remains pronounced, and this is a cause for concern.

As a loyal Samsung cus"

sreebha,touch is not working and handset got struck,"I am very much disappointed with this samsung a14 handset. In the first use it self i felt some problem in touch. Some time the touch is normal but some time i need to touch two three times with more pressure. As i started using the phone i didnt want to return so i took it as minor issue. I have already spend money for the cover, screen guard charge etc. But Yesterday evening (5th March 2024) exactly one month after the purchase of this phone it got struck and touch is not at all working. I couldn't even switch it off. When i long press on right button the screen will show switch off, restart options but as touch is not working can't select the option. The shorts which was playing, it was continuously playing. Message alert was also shows. What will i do?. Please replace with a new working handset."
Vipin,Not customer friendly,"1. Basic stuff not provided in the pack.
- no charger nor cable
- no screen guard
- no basic cover
2. Seting up and transfering from ur previous Android to samsung Android phone is a task.
Not at all user friendly. Makes u download their app.. And it's a time consuming process

Had brought it for my mom. Had to struggle setting it up. Good I was there or else it wud be a task for some one non tech friendly.

Manish Kumar Aditya,Fine phone with amazing battery but one major issue,Fine phone with really good camera and support of software. It's battery is a monster even with a heavy usage it does not drain much. Nice looks and have good weigh distribution. It's LCD screen but really nice color. Good network bandwidth. The only main issue with this phone is that heating issues. Even with normal web browsing the phone heats so much. I can't image how much it will when I play a game.
