Not satisfied
I need my money back samsung
Although I have keypad phone but don't waste ur money buying materialistic things instead donte it to me GOD will bless you üòÇüòÖ"
,Doesn't feel like a flagship,"First of all the violet with titanium sides looks really ugly. Looks like someone added a cheap cover to the phone. The phone is boxy and screen real estate feels low. The camera holes and placement looks cheap. Samsung's fast charging doesn't even come close to One Plus. And the Samsung UI is terrible. Contrary to what you may hear from youtube personalities, this phone is actually pretty below average."
This watch is really worth for money. This watch has extra features then what I expected. A great deal.,Best smartphone of 2024,Highly recommend this in this segment

AJ,Sold my car to buy this,"What an amazing product.

After seeing the glowing reviews, I had to go and experience this god send product in the Samsung store myself.

After playing with it in the store, taking pics of other phones and strangers in the store, I fell in love.

I sold my car the next day to get money for this as it was more viable over selling kidney or other organs. I also sold my only double bed, table and old phone to get the 512gb version because who needs SD cards.

After buying it with cash (since I don't like taking loans) I was truly blown away. I now Uber everywhere or walk and take pictures on the way. Sometimes some may say that I look like a creep with the amazing zoom but who cares. I paid for it.

This is trully the best phone on the market hands down. I am planning to sell my house and potentially the first born for future upgrades of this esteemed phone."
Divit,Best phone ever.,"This product is very nice with Galaxy AI. Camera is totally superb with 100x zoom.
It is best phone in the entire universe."

,S22Ultra User to S24 Ultra User Persistent Signal Issues,"One thing. Regret buying this too much of advertised device. You would be surprised to hear S22Ultra had IP68 rating and still dust entered my camera lens internally. On top of it I was always out of network. Heart said to go
For iPhone which is consistent but went for S24 Ultra. The problem I inherited from S22 Ultra is of signal. Usually there is no network or I loose network while on a call or connecting to laptop through Hotspot. I changed SIM cards, ported to other network but the problem persisted.Did a google review on this and looks like I am not the only user with this problem. All the Ultra series right from S22 to S 24 have this problem. I inserted the same Sim in a 15K phone Samsung A13 and I had no such problem. So for almost 1 lakh rupees after exchange I have a brick for their advertised stuff instead would have bought DSLR. I cannot return but will have to endure it for sometime. Hence Regret massive regret to purchase this device. The decision is upon you folks and your own personal experience. For me it turned out a crap.
Good things are screen, photography, UI smoothness."
Ashish C.,One of the best smartphones available as for 2024.,"Booked my 12+512gb version as soon as it was launched. And after using it for more than a month, here's my review.
Pros
1) exceptional camera quality. The 12MP ultra-wide does it's job and I would say going for 5x optical zoom with 50MP sensor instead for 10x 10MP sensor is a better choice as upto 30x I would say the pictures are more crisp than S23 ultra.

2) Build quality is premium. It feels like a high budget smartphone. Not sure if titanium armor is enough to withstand high drop possibilities, but it does make it lighter.

3) Screen is a big improvement. The anti reflective Corning Gorilla glass armor does it's job and reflects most of the glare so you can sit easily and watch without worrying if the person sitting next to you is watching coz they can't. üòÅ

3) S-pen has improved a bit. A lot of people are saying that they don't use it much after first time, but that's not the case with me. If you will get the hang of it, you will use it quite often.

4) AI interface is quite excellent. Although in initial phase, it does it's job in notes and summarising big pages so that you can easily get the gist.

5) 7 years OS and security update is a big big up from my side.

6) The box like built rather than a curve display is a better choice. It's easier to find a screen protector.

7) sanpdragan 8 gen3 is fast. You can play high end games at maximum capacity. Android 14 with one UI 6 is smooth as you can hope it would be. I haven't recorded any lags or heating issues as for now.

Cons
1) Anti refective display works until you put the above mention screen protector. After that it won't work with that precision. Although it still does it's job.

2) Selfie camera is still not that great if you're using iPhone 14 or 15 pro.

3) generative AI is not that great in calls and photo editing. Also, to pay for these services after 2025 is a big drawback from Samsung.

4) Samsung is still not implementing faster charging protocols on their high and mid range smartphones. In a time when OnePlus is offering 100W charging speeds and xiomi offering 50-80W wireless charging, Samsung is still stuck with 45W and 15W wireless charging. Big drawback. However, battery do last for a full day.

5) speaking of charging, no charger included is a serious letdown when you're spending more than a lac on a high end smartphone. Samsung, it doesn't feels good. üòî

Overall, a good smartphone if you're thinking to go for a big one for a long time."
,What a mobile device it is! Beautiful and the Beast!,"What is there not to like in the S24 Ultra? But I was happiest about the flat screen this time around as I had had enough of the curved screens in the previous iterations.
I have been using the device since almost over a month now and I am very happy with its performance.
The camera is the Show Stopper and the AI features are the toppings.
Fall in love with the S Ultra series all over again."
