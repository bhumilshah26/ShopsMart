Placeholder,Good product,Light weight - not too big or small. Right size to handle work. Soft touch response. I am happy with this product.
,A laptop that deserves more attention!,"It's a nice budget laptop. Reviewing it after 4 days of using. As of now, there is no problem, speed, battery, and display are all top notch. The 180Â° hinge adds to the acceptability of this laptop. Lenovo has taken special attention to the build quality, a must for long-term usage.

Will try to give a review after a few weeks."
