Akshay,Budget laptop with sleep issues and poor support,"I bought this as a second portable laptop. I use a more powerful one as my desktop replacement. Let's go through the clichéd pros and cons, shall we?
Before that I should mention the biggest issue I've had with this. It DOES NOT enter sleep state correctly.
The fan keeps spinning in windows and this will be a drain in the sleep state. There's NO updated BIOS as of now to fix that. In Linux it just hangs after trying to wake up from sleep.

Pros:
1. Good price
2. Surprisingly good build quality except for the keyboard which feels cheap
3. Decent number of expansion ports
4. It had a spare 2.5 inch disk slot which was not mentioned in the specs. Bonus expansion slot!
Cons:
1. Cheap internal components (Ram and SSD), though they'll definitely last the warranty period.
2. Stupid policy of not letting users open their laptop without voiding warranty. What do these people think we are? Lemmings?
3. Cheap BIOS with no features
4. No Drivers/BIOS updates on the website.

That last one is the worst, coupled with no BIOS updates which might have fixed the sleep issue. I did some investigation and the issue is that it's not going into ""s2idle"" state correctly and the BIOS only advertises that state. Windows somehow just keeps the fan running on trying to sleep which means it's going into S2 state and not ""s2idle"" which is supposed to replace S3 state.

The BIOS is very cheap and basic with no options to control sleep states, SMART reporting or other advanced features. You can at least expect sleep state control. In Linux, I'm having to use hibernate instead which works if I turn secure boot off, but it's slow.

I would avoid this brand in the future and advise others to do the same. Extremely frustrated with the experience."
girijashankar,Keypad is very bad.,"Features of this laptop is attractive but screen quality is not good , view angle is also not good, and worst thing is the keypad , right shift key is small and postion is also not good , keyboard is not practical , very difficult to use , i suggest not buy this this one , just because of keyboard ."
,Walue for money,But display angle is not good
Sameer kumar,It is lagging already..,"I received this laptop with open( teared amazon box) but since laptop was untampered I let it go. Firstly, this is my first laptop so I'll just type in my experience.

It is lagging even to run prince of Persia ( which is a small game,) ..

Also there are constant lags even which doing simple stuff on this laptop.

There seems to a problem, it takes a minute to wake up from sleep mode and power button keeps blinking....I think it's an issue

Battery doesn't last well...it comes to 30% with only 3 hours of usage, but since it has a fast charger it gets charged quickly.

There is no backlit keyboard, and screen is worse... it'll have to be at a certain angle to view things clearly.

performance is good ( as I only used ms edge so far, yet I experienced lags while closing and adding new Tabs. I'll update more with time.

Ajay,best at this price,I am using this for trading purpose and the laptop is fine only if Backlight keyboard was available and delivery was too long. otherwise it's fast machine 16 gb ram is awesome
Get today nice product 😃😃,Value for Money Purchase at rs 37000,"Good Build Quality - Keyboard material is not as good as it must be
Speakers have low bass and volume, shrill audio quality
No Heating or reboot issue as of now ie 10 days
Best specs for the price"
DT,OK as per price,User experience is not upto the mark as compared to competition. Quite a few things could have been better just with common sense. I really like its overall look and feel and thin and light profile. So price vs quality and experience is ok.
Placeholder,Average display poor sound,"Performance not that much for being an i7 processor. Windows 11 consumes average of 8 GB out of 16 GB with Outlook client and 4 tabs open in browser .

Though it is a SSD feels like normal hdd.

Acer can do much better for this price segment"
Ishwarlal C.,Good,Happy
Ravi Gupta,Suddenly Display got stuck while running,"Don't buy this product, this laptop suddenly stops working while doing some basic work. After that you have to do manually poweroff and once turn off the laptop you can't turn on the laptop, no matter how much amount you try to turn on this laptop. After 2 days it will be fixed without doing anything. You come across this problem several times."

Deep Prajapati,First of all this laptop is so nice and wonderful with grey colour,"Any person purchase the laptop this laptop is very pretty gorgeous and wonderful and signing so I will suggest you purchase this with money worth. If you are purchasing this laptop. If you want to purchase a laptop, then you may regret purchasing it because it is a very good laptop.under 35000 ryzen5 with graphic cards / 180 hinge design/ hdd and SSD both storage/ metal body/ HD cam/👍👌"
,A perfect product at a great price of Rs. 35000,"I would say a good buy for the asking price of Rs. 35,000 including GST. You get 16 GB RAM, 500 GB SSD and relatively latest Ryzen 5 processor and to top it all Windows 11 OS. The only thing missing is MS Office for which you have to shell out extra, that is if one requires MS Office."
Indus Corporation (India),Best for gaming,Due to performance this laptop is value for money. This laptop (16GB) smoothly runs GTA V in 1080p with 40fps and Valorant in 1080p with 150fps average. I did not expect such a performance.
Placeholder,Decent laptop works well,Best in this price range (30k) came as it was listed as the back had metal finish and looked premium and is very fast

Placeholder,Disappointed by the product,"Recived this product with under side screws in distorted condition , seems like someone has opened it. Amazon can't be trusted anymore. I recommend don't buy expensive things on amazone. Also the body of laptop doesn't feel like metal, I think it is plastic with metal color coating."
