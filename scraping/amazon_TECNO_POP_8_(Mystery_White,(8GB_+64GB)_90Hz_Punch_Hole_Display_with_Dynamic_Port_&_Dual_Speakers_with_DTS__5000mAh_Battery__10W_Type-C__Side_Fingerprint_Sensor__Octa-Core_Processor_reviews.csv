krishna kumar,Good Mobile,"I bought this mobile for my relatives. My friends said ""don't buy it. It is not a branded"" But i bought it with self belief. This mobile is good. relatives and their colleagues also happy to see it. everyone praise for its style and look. I don't know how it works. Relative says, Phone is good and works well. Nothing is branded. Quality makes company branded. One day this company also will be a brand."

3) Decent processor + 4GB RAM
4) included accessories
5) less bloatware or ads(you can easily uninstall/disable them)
6) Daytime photos and videos are good
7) Dual speaker dts functionality improved after update

Cons
1) charging time very high, more than 2.5 hrs

3) Memory fusion is a gimmick(The ROM is emmc type not ufs)
4) Night or artificial light photo not good, too much noise"

Fire,It's a bang for 6000rs,"Stunning look,dts,dual speaker really make deference in music listening, fast and responsive basic use not tried gaming yet"
jayant darke,Average Phone,"It's a bore phone, it has all sensors but no option to use them. Like gesture to double tap and wake or lock screen is missing, app lock is missing, the dynamic port is active only for notifications else it vanishes. It has custom UI but it needs alot of development. Camera is average, when you zoom the picture tears no clarity. They really need to buckup. These small small features are the aesthetics that customers look for in a phone and surprisingly inspite of all the features there we can't use them. Bore phone, won't recommend. 3 stars for Android T.

Also it's battery life is average, if you are a heavy user you'll have to plug in charger after half day."
